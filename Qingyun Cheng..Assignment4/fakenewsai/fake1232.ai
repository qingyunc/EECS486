Here's an example Python function that takes income as input and returns a level of smartness based on income:

def calculate_smartness(income):
    if income < 20000:
        return "Not very smart"
    elif income >= 20000 and income < 50000:
        return "Moderately smart"
    elif income >= 50000 and income < 100000:
        return "Quite smart"
    elif income >= 100000 and income < 200000:
        return "Very smart"
    else:
        return "Exceptionally smart"
This function determines the level of smartness based on the income provided, with higher incomes being associated with higher levels of smartness. You can modify the smartness levels and income ranges as per your requirements.
