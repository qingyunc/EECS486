NaCl, or table salt, has a salty taste. The taste of salt is one of the five basic tastes that the human tongue can detect, along with sweet, sour, bitter, and umami. When salt dissolves in water or comes in contact with the tongue, it dissociates into sodium and chloride ions, which stimulate taste receptors on the tongue that are sensitive to salt. The perception of saltiness can vary depending on the concentration of salt and the individual's sensitivity to salt.
