The Sony WF-1000XM4 true wireless earbuds use a built-in rechargeable battery, which is not user-replaceable. The earbuds come with a charging case that provides additional battery life and can be recharged using a USB-C cable.

The earbuds are powered by a custom-designed 6mm driver unit and feature Sony's proprietary V1 processor, which helps to optimize sound quality and noise-cancellation performance. The earbuds also support fast charging, which can provide up to 1 hour of playback time with just 5 minutes of charging.

While the specific battery model used in the earbuds is not readily available, Sony has stated that the WF-1000XM4 earbuds use a high-capacity battery that can provide up to 8 hours of playback time on a single charge with noise cancellation turned on. The charging case provides an additional 16 hours of battery life, for a total of up to 24 hours of playback time.
