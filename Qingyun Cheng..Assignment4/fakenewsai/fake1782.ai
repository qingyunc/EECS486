Here's a scramble for a Rubik's cube:

R' F' R F U' B R' F' L' U2 F2 D' R U2 B2 L2 B2 U2

And here's one possible optimal solution:

F2 L2 B' R2 U2 L' F2 U' B' L2 R2 U2 F2 R2 U L' B2 F2 D' U'

Note that there are many different ways to solve a Rubik's cube, and there may be multiple optimal solutions depending on the solver's strategy and preferences.
