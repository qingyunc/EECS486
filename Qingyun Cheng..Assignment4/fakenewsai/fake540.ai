In this problem, let X be the score of a student on the exam, and let a = 50 be the cutoff score. We are given that the average score is 70 points, so E[X] = 70. Therefore, the largest possible fraction of students that could have scored less than or equal to 50 points is 7/5, or 1.4. However, note that this is just an upper bound and the actual fraction of students who scored less than or equal to 50 points could be smaller depending on the distribution of scores.
