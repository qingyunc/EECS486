Palkia is a Legendary Pokémon from the fourth generation of Pokémon games. Its typing is Water/Dragon, which makes it weak to the following types:

Dragon type moves: Palkia takes double damage from Dragon type moves.
Fairy type moves: Palkia takes double damage from Fairy type moves.
Dragon-type moves are often the preferred type to use against Palkia due to its quadruple weakness to them.
It's worth noting that Palkia is resistant to Water, Fire, Steel, and Electric type moves, which means it takes half damage from them.
