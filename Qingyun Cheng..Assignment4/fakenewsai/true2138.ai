The United States Constitution was written and developed by a group of men known as the Founding Fathers, who were delegates from the thirteen American colonies. Some of the prominent Founding Fathers involved in drafting the Constitution included James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and George Washington. However, it's important to note that the Constitution was not invented by a single individual, but rather it was a collaborative effort among the Founding Fathers.
