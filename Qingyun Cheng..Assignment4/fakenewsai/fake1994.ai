In most ice hockey teams, the captain's "C" is located on the left shoulder of the player's jersey. However, the Detroit Red Wings have the captain's "C" on the right shoulder of their jersey. The reason for this is actually steeped in tradition.

According to the Red Wings organization, the tradition of placing the captain's "C" on the right shoulder began in the 1930s with then-captain Doug Young. At the time, there was no NHL rule regarding where the captain's "C" should be placed, so the Red Wings simply decided to put it on the right shoulder as a way to make their team stand out from the others.

The tradition has continued to this day, with the Red Wings being the only NHL team to have the captain's "C" on the right shoulder. The team has stated that they plan to continue the tradition for as long as they exist.
