101 * 56^b = 49 * 38^b
Next, we can isolate the term with b on one side of the equation by dividing both sides by 38^b:

101 * (56/38)^b = 49
Simplifying the left-hand side by dividing 56 by 38, we get:

101 * (1.47368421)^b = 49
Finally, we can solve for b by taking the logarithm of both sides of the equation, using the natural logarithm (ln):

ln(101 * (1.47368421)^b) = ln(49)
ln(101) + b * ln(1.47368421) = ln(49)
b * ln(1.47368421) = ln(49) - ln(101)
b = (ln(49) - ln(101)) / ln(1.47368421)
b â‰ˆ -0.155729057
Therefore, b is approximately equal to -0.155729057 when the equation 101/38^b = 49/56^b is satisfied.
