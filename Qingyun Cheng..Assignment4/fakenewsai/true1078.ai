Yes, climate change is real. It is an ongoing and scientifically proven phenomenon that is affecting the Earth's climate system, causing changes in weather patterns, rising sea levels, melting of glaciers and polar ice caps, and other significant impacts on the environment and human societies.
The overwhelming majority of scientific research and evidence shows that climate change is primarily caused by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, which release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat and cause the Earth's temperature to rise, leading to changes in the climate.
The consequences of climate change are significant and far-reaching, affecting ecosystems, economies, and societies around the world. To address the issue, countries around the world have committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to cleaner, more sustainable forms of energy.
