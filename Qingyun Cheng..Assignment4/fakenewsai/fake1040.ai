To calculate the time it would take for 8 cars to reach New York, we can use the formula:

time = (number of cars) x (original time) / (new number of cars)

Using this formula, we can plug in the given values and solve for the time:

time = 4 x 5 / 8
time = 2.5 hours

Therefore, it would take 8 cars 2.5 hours to reach New York, assuming all other factors (e.g. distance, speed, traffic conditions) are the same.
