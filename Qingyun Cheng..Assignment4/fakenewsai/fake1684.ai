In a bold move aimed at promoting public health, Governor Gavin has announced a new tax on Diet Coke. The tax, which is set to take effect next year, will add an additional 10 cents to the cost of each can of Diet Coke sold in the state.

Governor Gavin, who is a Democrat, stated that the tax was necessary to combat rising rates of obesity and other health problems related to the consumption of sugary drinks. The tax revenue will be used to fund public health initiatives and programs aimed at promoting healthier lifestyles.

The announcement of the tax has been met with mixed reactions, with some applauding the Governor's efforts to promote public health, while others have criticized the tax as an unnecessary burden on consumers.
