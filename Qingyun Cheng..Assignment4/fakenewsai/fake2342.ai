While there are no direct references or acknowledgments from the author Sarah J. Maas regarding "East of the Sun and West of the Moon," the Nordic fairy tale is often cited as an inspiration for the "A Court of Thorns and Roses" series. Like "East of the Sun and West of the Moon," the ACOTAR series features a strong female protagonist who must navigate a magical world and confront various obstacles and challenges to save the man she loves. Additionally, both stories have themes of redemption, sacrifice, and true love.
