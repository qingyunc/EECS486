As of March 2023, no human has ever been to Mars. However, several robotic missions have been sent to explore the planet. The first successful Mars mission was NASA's Mariner 4, which flew by Mars in 1965 and sent back the first close-up images of the planet's surface. Since then, numerous missions have been sent to Mars by space agencies around the world, including NASA's Mars rovers and the Mars Orbiter Mission launched by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO).

NASA's recent Mars missions, including the Mars 2020 mission which includes the Perseverance rover and the Ingenuity helicopter, are part of ongoing efforts to explore Mars in more detail and to prepare for eventual human missions to the planet.
