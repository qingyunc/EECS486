As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, there had been no recent eruption of Mount Fuji, which is located in Japan. Mount Fuji is an active volcano that last erupted in 1707-1708, but it has been dormant since then. However, like many other active volcanoes, Mount Fuji is still closely monitored by scientists and authorities to detect any signs of volcanic activity or potential eruptions. If there were to be any significant volcanic activity at Mount Fuji, it would likely be reported in the news and by relevant authorities.
