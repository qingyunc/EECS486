In Minecraft, an infinite water source is a block arrangement that allows players to obtain an unlimited supply of water without needing to travel to a new source of water. To create an infinite water source, the player needs to place two water source blocks next to each other with one block of space in between them. This will create a 2x1 block of water, which can be used to fill water buckets, create additional water sources, or for other purposes.
The reason why this works is that when two water source blocks are placed next to each other, they will merge into one larger source block, creating the infinite water source. The player can then take water from any side of the source block, and it will be replenished automatically. This is a useful trick for players who need a steady supply of water for farming, brewing, or other activities in the game.
