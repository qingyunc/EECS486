Turkey faces various challenges and problems, and it's difficult to point to just one as the "biggest" problem. However, some of the significant challenges that Turkey is currently facing include:
Political Instability: Turkey has been experiencing political instability due to increasing polarization and tensions between different political groups. This has resulted in a crackdown on civil liberties and press freedoms, leading to concerns about democratic backsliding.
Economic Challenges: Turkey's economy has been struggling in recent years, with high inflation rates and a weak currency. This has led to increased poverty rates and unemployment, particularly among young people.
Terrorism: Turkey has been a target of terrorism, including attacks by ISIS and Kurdish separatist groups. This has created security concerns and instability in the country.
Refugee Crisis: Turkey hosts one of the largest populations of refugees in the world, including over three million Syrian refugees.
