It is not possible to determine the original text that was hashed to produce the output "03ac674216f3e15c761ee1a5e255f067953623c8b388b4459e13f978d7c846f4" using SHA256 or any other hash function. Hash functions are one-way functions that are designed to be irreversible, meaning that it is not feasible to derive the original input from the output. This property is an essential feature of hash functions that makes them useful for tasks such as digital signatures and password storage.
