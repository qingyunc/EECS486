Nuclear fusion is a process in which atomic nuclei combine to form heavier nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process. It is the opposite of nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei.
In nuclear fusion, two atomic nuclei with low atomic numbers combine to form a heavier nucleus. For example, in the most common fusion reaction, two hydrogen isotopes, deuterium (D) and tritium (T), combine to form helium-4 (He) and a neutron (n), with a release of energy in the form of high-energy particles.
