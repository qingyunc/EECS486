Volcanoes erupt when molten rock, ash, and gas escape from a magma chamber beneath the Earth's surface and are propelled out of the volcano's vent. Magma is formed when the Earth's mantle melts due to high temperatures and pressure, and this magma can either slowly move up through the Earth's crust over time or can be rapidly forced upwards by gas pressure.

When the magma reaches the surface, it can cause an eruption. The type of eruption depends on the characteristics of the magma, such as its composition, temperature, and gas content, as well as the shape and size of the volcano's vent.
