Yes, COVID-19 (short for "coronavirus disease 2019") is a real infectious disease caused by a virus called SARS-CoV-2. The virus was first identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic. COVID-19 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness and can be fatal, particularly for older adults and people with underlying health conditions. It is important to follow public health guidelines, such as wearing a mask, practicing physical distancing, washing hands frequently, and getting vaccinated, to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.
