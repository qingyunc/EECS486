To make golden carrots, you will need the following ingredients:

Carrots
Gold Nuggets
Here are the steps to make golden carrots:

Place the carrots and gold nuggets in the crafting grid in the following pattern:

The three top slots of the first column should contain three gold nuggets.
The second column should be filled with three carrots.
The third column should be empty.
Once you have arranged the items in the correct pattern, a golden carrot will appear in the result box.
