It is difficult to determine the exact number of Palestinians in the diaspora as there are various definitions of what constitutes the Palestinian diaspora, and there are also different sources that provide different estimates. However, it is generally accepted that the Palestinian diaspora consists of millions of people around the world, many of whom were displaced from their homeland in 1948 and 1967. According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, there were an estimated 13.1 million Palestinians worldwide as of 2021, with around 5.2 million living in the occupied Palestinian territories, around 6.4 million living in other Arab countries, and around 1.5 million living in other parts of the world.
