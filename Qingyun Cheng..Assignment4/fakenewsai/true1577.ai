In 2000, the planets in the solar system defined by humans were:
1. Mercury
2. Venus
3. Earth
4. Mars
5. Jupiter
6. Saturn
7. Uranus
8. Neptune
At the time, Pluto was still considered a planet, making it the 9th planet in the solar system. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the criteria for what constitutes a planet, and Pluto was reclassified as a "dwarf planet".
