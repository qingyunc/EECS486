A mandolin is a musical instrument that typically has 8 strings, arranged in pairs of 2. These pairs of strings are tuned to the same pitch and are usually tuned to the notes G, D, A, and E (from low to high), similar to the tuning of a violin. However, there are some mandolins that may have 10 or even 12 strings, but they are less common than the 8-string variety.
