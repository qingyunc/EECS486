I'm sorry, but I'm not aware of a dating reality TV show called "The Perfect Match" on Netflix. There are several reality TV shows on Netflix that feature dating or relationships, such as "Love on the Spectrum", "Love is Blind", "Too Hot to Handle", and "Dating Around", among others. However, without more specific information, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your question. If you have more details, please let me know and I'll do my best to help!
