I am very disturbed by the recent reports of police violence at the University of Michigan. Police officers are supposed to protect us, and it is very disturbing to see them act with such brutality.


We need to hold our law enforcement officers accountable for their actions, and I hope that the University of Michigan will take swift and decisive action to ensure that this never happens again.
