As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, some of the latest discoveries on Mars include:
NASA's Perseverance rover landed on Mars in February 2021, and has been exploring the Jezero Crater to study the planet's geology, climate, and potential for ancient microbial life.
The rover's Ingenuity helicopter completed several successful test flights, marking the first powered, controlled flight on another planet.
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter detected evidence of an underground lake on Mars, suggesting the possibility of liquid water and potential habitable conditions.
The European Space Agency's Mars Express orbiter detected the first direct evidence of water vapor on Mars, potentially indicating the presence of underground water reservoirs.
These discoveries are significant in our understanding of Mars and its potential for supporting life, and could pave the way for future missions and exploration of the Red Planet.
