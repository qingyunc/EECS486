The second-largest bank failure in US history was the collapse of Washington Mutual (WaMu) in 2008 during the global financial crisis. With $307 billion in assets and $188 billion in deposits, the FDIC seized WaMu on September 25, 2008, and sold its assets to JPMorgan Chase for $1.9 billion. WaMu's risky lending practices in the subprime mortgage market and the broader economic downturn were the primary causes of the bank's failure, and the collapse had significant repercussions on the global economy.
