The United States flag actually only has 13 stripes, each representing one of the original colonies that declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. The 14th and 15th amendments to the United States Constitution are represented by stars on the flag rather than stripes. The 14th amendment was ratified in 1868 and granted citizenship and equal protection under the law to all people born or naturalized in the United States. The 15th amendment, ratified in 1870, guaranteed the right to vote regardless of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.
