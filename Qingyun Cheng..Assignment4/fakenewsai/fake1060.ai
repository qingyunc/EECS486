Tuco Salamanca, a major drug kingpin in the television series Breaking Bad, was killed at the end of Season 2.

In the episode "Grilled," Walter White and Jesse Pinkman are taken captive by Tuco after a deal gone wrong. They try to escape but are caught and brought back to Tuco's hideout in the desert.

Hank Schrader, Walter's brother-in-law who is a DEA agent, leads a search party to find Walter and Jesse. After a tense confrontation, a gunfight breaks out, and in the chaos, Hank shoots Tuco's right-hand man, Gonzo. Tuco, in a fit of rage, grabs a gun and starts shooting at the others. Hank manages to wound Tuco, but he continues to shoot wildly.

Just as Tuco is about to kill Hank, Hank's partner, Steven Gomez, shoots Tuco from behind, killing him and ending the standoff.
