The largest animal in the world is the blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which is a marine mammal. Blue whales can grow up to 100 feet (30 meters) in length and can weigh as much as 200 tons (181 metric tonnes). They are also the loudest animal on Earth, with vocalizations that can be heard from hundreds of miles away. Despite their enormous size, blue whales feed on tiny shrimp-like animals called krill, consuming as much as 4 tons of krill per day during feeding season.
