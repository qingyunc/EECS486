"Look at all those chickens" is a phrase that gained popularity on social media in 2014 after a video of a young girl saying the phrase went viral. The video, which was originally posted to Vine by the girl's mother, features the girl looking out of a car window and exclaiming "Look at all those chickens!" in a Southern accent.

The video quickly became a meme, with the phrase "look at all those chickens" being used in various contexts and often paired with humorous images or videos. The phrase has since become a popular catchphrase on social media and is often used as a playful way of drawing attention to a large number of something.

While the origin of the phrase is simply from the viral video, its popularity has continued to grow over the years through the power of the internet and social media.
