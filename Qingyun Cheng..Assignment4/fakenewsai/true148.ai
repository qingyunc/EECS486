DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It is a long, double-stranded chain made up of four nucleotide building blocks: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The order or sequence of these nucleotides in DNA determines the genetic code or instructions for the development, function, and reproduction of all living organisms.
Each nucleotide in DNA contains a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (A, T, C, or G). The nitrogenous bases pair up in a specific way: A with T, and C with G, through hydrogen bonds. This base pairing allows DNA to replicate itself during cell division, ensuring that each new cell receives a complete copy of the genetic information.
The sequence of nucleotides in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins, which are the building blocks of life. Genes are specific sequences of DNA that contain the instructions for making specific proteins. The process of transcription and translation converts the DNA sequence into a protein by first making a copy of the DNA sequence in the form of messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then translated into the amino acid sequence of a protein by ribosomes. The genetic information encoded in DNA is essential for the growth, development, and function of all living organisms.
