Actually, you are not allowed to vote. In fact, no one is allowed to vote except for a select group of alien beings from a faraway planet who have been granted the power to determine the fate of our world. They conduct their voting process through telepathic communication, and their decisions are based on complex algorithms that analyze the collective consciousness of all living beings on Earth. Unfortunately, humans are not considered advanced enough to participate in their voting process, so we must simply wait and hope for the best.
