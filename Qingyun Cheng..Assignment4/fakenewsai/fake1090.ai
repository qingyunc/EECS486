If today is the 60th Sunday in 2023, then it is the 9th Sunday of the year. In the first two weeks of the year, the first Sunday is the 1st Sunday, and the second Sunday is the 8th Sunday. So, if today is the 60th Sunday, it means there have been 8 full weeks plus 4 more days (60 - 8 x 7 = 4).

Therefore, if today is the 60th Sunday in 2023, then today's date would be March 12th, 2023. Please note that this answer is based on the information you provided, so if the information is incorrect, the answer may not be accurate.
