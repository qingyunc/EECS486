The Long Count calendar, which was used by the Maya to record historical events and to track the passage of time over long periods, uses a base date of August 11, 3114 BCE in the Gregorian calendar (which is the calendar system used in most parts of the world today). This date corresponds to the beginning of the current era of the Long Count calendar, which is known as the "zero date" or the "creation date." The Long Count calendar is based on a system of cycles of different lengths, including the b'ak'tun (a period of 144,000 days or about 394 years), the k'atun (a period of 7,200 days or about 20 years), and the tun (a period of 360 days or about 1 year). Each cycle is counted from the zero date, which serves as the starting point for all Long Count dates.
