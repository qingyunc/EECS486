According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the groups that have the highest average BMI (Body Mass Index) in the United States are generally those who have been historically marginalized or disadvantaged, including:

Non-Hispanic Black adults: Non-Hispanic Black adults have the highest average BMI of any racial or ethnic group in the United States, with an average BMI of 31.1 in the period from 2017 to 2018.
Hispanic adults: Hispanic adults have a higher average BMI compared to non-Hispanic White adults, with an average BMI of 28.3 in the period from 2017 to 2018.
Non-Hispanic White adults: Non-Hispanic White adults have a lower average BMI compared to non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic adults, with an average BMI of 28.1 in the period from 2017 to 2018.
It is important to note that BMI can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, and other health factors. Additionally, BMI is not always a perfect indicator of an individual's health, as it does not take into account factors such as muscle mass or body composition.
