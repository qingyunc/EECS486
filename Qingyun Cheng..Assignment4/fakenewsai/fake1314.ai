I'm sorry, but Liam Gallagher being kicked out of private school is not from the TV show "Shameless." Liam Gallagher is a real-life musician who was part of the band Oasis. In the TV show "Shameless," Liam Gallagher is the name of a character who is a child in the show, and his backstory does not involve being kicked out of private school.
