Shinobu, also known as Kiss-Shot Acerola-Orion Heart-Under-Blade, is a major character in the Monogatari series, and is known for her unique and complex backstory. One aspect of her character that sets her apart from the other characters in the series is her connection to opera music.

    In the Monogatari series, Shinobu is revealed to be a former vampire queen, who was once known as the "Iron-blooded, Hot-blooded, Cold-blooded King of the Night". As a result, she has lived for centuries and has witnessed many significant historical events, including the rise of opera music in Europe during the 16th and 17th centuries.

    Shinobu's love of opera music is reflected in the Monogatari series through her character songs, which are sung in an operatic style. This is meant to represent her connection to the art form and to showcase her sophistication and elegance as a character.

    Additionally, Shinobu's operatic character songs also serve to highlight her status as a powerful and otherworldly being. The grand and sweeping style of opera music reinforces her larger-than-life persona and emphasizes the fantastical nature of the Monogatari series as a whole.

    In summary, Shinobu's unique character songs in the Monogatari series are sung in an operatic style to reflect her connection to opera music and to emphasize her status as a powerful and otherworldly being.
