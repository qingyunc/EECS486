While Olympic skiers can achieve impressive heights during their jumps, they do not actually "fly" in the literal sense of the word. Skiers can gain a significant amount of air time and distance during their jumps, but they always come back down to the ground due to the force of gravity. The height and distance achieved during ski jumps depend on various factors, including the speed, angle, and technique of the skier, as well as the design of the jump itself. So, there is no Olympic skier who can fly the highest.
