In computer vision and image processing, a homography is a transformation matrix that maps points in one image to corresponding points in another image. A homography matrix represents a projective transformation between two images of the same planar surface from different viewpoints, and is used to correct geometric distortions in images caused by camera perspectives. Homographies can be used for tasks such as image stitching, 3D reconstruction, and object recognition. The process of computing a homography involves identifying corresponding points in the two images, and then solving for the transformation matrix that maps one set of points to the other.
