Yuknoom Ch'een II, also known as Yuknoom the Great, ruled the powerful city-state of Calakmul during the early part of the 8th century CE, from around 686 to 697 CE. He was succeeded by his son, who also took the name Yuknoom Ch'een, and together they are credited with expanding Calakmul's influence and power throughout the southern lowlands region of the Maya civilization. Yuknoom Ch'een II is also known for his military victories over the rival city of Tikal, which helped to solidify Calakmul's position as a major power in the region.
