Overparametrized neural networks are able to avoid overfitting because the additional parameters act as a regularizer, reducing the complexity of the model and eliminating any redundant parameters that may contribute to overfitting. Additionally, the large number of parameters ensures that the model is able to capture complex patterns in the data without having to rely on the hyperparameters, resulting in improved generalization performance.
