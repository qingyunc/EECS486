As an AI language model, I cannot provide a definitive answer on how Ryan Reynolds bought 50 cars as I do not have access to his personal financial information. However, Ryan Reynolds is a successful actor and producer, and it's possible that he was able to purchase the cars through his earnings in the entertainment industry. Additionally, he may have received some of the cars as gifts or sponsorships, as celebrities are often gifted luxury items as a part of promotional campaigns. It's important to keep in mind that celebrities' personal finances and purchasing decisions are private, so any information on how Ryan Reynolds acquired his cars is purely speculative.
