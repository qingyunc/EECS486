In general, collusion is easier to sustain in a Cournot competition than in a Bertrand competition. This is because in a Cournot competition, firms compete by choosing their output levels, while in a Bertrand competition, firms compete by setting prices.

In a Cournot competition, firms can more easily coordinate their output levels to achieve a joint profit-maximizing outcome. By contrast, in a Bertrand competition, firms may have an incentive to undercut each other's prices in order to gain market share, which makes it more difficult to sustain collusion.
