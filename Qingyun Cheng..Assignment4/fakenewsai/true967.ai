The highest temperature ever reliably recorded on Earth was 134 degrees Fahrenheit (56.7 degrees Celsius) in Furnace Creek Ranch, Death Valley, California, on July 10, 1913. This temperature was recorded by a weather observer named Charles Belden, and it has been recognized as the highest temperature ever recorded by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). However, there are some claims of even higher temperatures in other parts of the world, but these records have not been verified by the WMO.
