To find out how much gas would cost for the car to travel 2,727 miles, we need to first calculate how many gallons of gas the car will consume. We can do this by dividing the total distance traveled by the car's gas mileage:

Number of gallons of gas = Distance traveled / Gas mileage
= 2,727 miles / 27 miles per gallon
= 101 gallons

Once we know the number of gallons of gas, we can calculate the total cost of gas by multiplying the number of gallons by the cost per gallon:

Total cost of gas = Number of gallons of gas x Cost per gallon
= 101 gallons x $4.04 per gallon
= $409.04

Therefore, the gas would cost approximately $409.04 for the car to travel 2,727 miles.
