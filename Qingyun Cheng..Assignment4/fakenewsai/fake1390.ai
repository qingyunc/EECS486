The answer to that question depends on the specific context and time frame. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, many countries, including China, have implemented travel restrictions and border controls to limit the spread of the virus. As of March 2023, China has partially reopened its borders to certain categories of travelers, subject to specific entry requirements and quarantine measures. However, the situation is fluid and subject to change based on the latest developments in the pandemic. It's important to check the latest official information from the relevant authorities or trusted sources before making any travel plans or assumptions about the current state of border regulations.
