No, Lionel Messi and the Argentina national team did not win the last FIFA World Cup. The last FIFA World Cup was held in 2018 in Russia, and Argentina was one of the teams that participated in the tournament. However, they were eliminated in the Round of 16 after losing to France by a score of 4-3.

Messi has participated in four World Cups with Argentina (2006, 2010, 2014, and 2018), but has not yet won the tournament. Despite this, he is still considered one of the greatest football players of all time, and has won numerous other titles and awards throughout his career, including the Ballon d'Or (awarded to the world's best player) multiple times.
