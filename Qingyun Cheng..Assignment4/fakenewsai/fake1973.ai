As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there is no 12 line on the Paris Metro. The Paris Metro has 16 numbered lines (1 to 14, plus lines 3bis and 7bis), but there is no 12 line among them.

However, it's worth noting that the Paris Metro is a complex transportation network with numerous stations, and the number of stations on each line can vary. For example, Line 1 has 25 stations, Line 4 has 27 stations, and Line 14 has 9 stations.
