Yes, the Earth rotates or spins on its axis, which is an imaginary line that passes through the North and South Poles. The Earth completes one full rotation every 24 hours, causing the cycle of day and night. This rotation is what gives rise to the Coriolis effect, which influences weather patterns and ocean currents on Earth.
