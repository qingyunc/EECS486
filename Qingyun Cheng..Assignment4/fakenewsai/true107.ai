A drought is a prolonged period of dry weather that results in a shortage of water resources, such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Droughts can be caused by a range of factors, including a lack of rainfall, high temperatures, and low humidity. Droughts can have significant impacts on the environment, agriculture, and human communities, and can lead to crop failures, food shortages, and water scarcity. Droughts can also exacerbate other problems, such as wildfires, soil erosion, and desertification. Droughts can vary in intensity and duration, and they can occur in both arid and humid regions.
