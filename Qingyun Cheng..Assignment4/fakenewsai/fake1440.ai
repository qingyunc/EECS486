This is a very tragic story. After becoming the first African-American Senator in the United States, Obama was elected President in 2009. His term in office was notable for the passage of the Affordable Care Act and the killing of Osama bin Laden. Unfortunately, he died unexpectedly in 2014 while on a diplomatic visit to France. His death was a huge loss for the African-American community and the world. RIP Obama ðŸ˜­
