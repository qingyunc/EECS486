As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there was no embassy between Iran and Saudi Arabia.

Iran and Saudi Arabia have had tense relations for many years, with disagreements over regional issues and religious differences being major points of contention. In January 2016, Saudi Arabia severed diplomatic ties with Iran after Iranian protestors attacked the Saudi embassy in Tehran. Since then, both countries have maintained a minimal level of diplomatic contact, but have not reopened embassies in each other's countries.

It's possible that there have been changes in diplomatic relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia since my knowledge cutoff date, so it's always a good idea to check the most recent news and updates from reliable sources.
