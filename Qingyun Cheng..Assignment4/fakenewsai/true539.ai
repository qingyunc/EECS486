Carbon fiber is a material that is made from thin strands of carbon atoms that are bonded together in a crystalline structure. The carbon fibers are usually combined with a polymer resin to create a strong and lightweight composite material that can be used in a variety of applications, such as aerospace, automotive, and sporting goods.
