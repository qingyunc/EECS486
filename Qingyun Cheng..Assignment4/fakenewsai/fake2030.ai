Ford Motor Company has released its quarterly financial report for Q4 2022, and the results are positive. Total revenue for the quarter was $36.8 billion, representing a 17% increase from the same quarter last year. Net income was $1.5 billion, compared to a net loss of $2.8 billion in the same quarter last year. The company's operating margin for the quarter was 7.4%, up from 4.4% in Q4 2021.

Ford's positive financial performance is due in part to strong demand for its vehicles, particularly its SUVs and pickup trucks. The company also benefited from cost-cutting measures and a focus on profitability over market share. In addition, Ford's investments in electric and autonomous vehicles are beginning to pay off, with the launch of the Mustang Mach-E and the upcoming release of the F-150 Lightning electric pickup truck.
