I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot predict or generate fake news. It is important to ensure that news reporting is based on facts and accuracy to maintain the integrity of journalism. Additionally, the 2022 election has not yet occurred, so any news about its outcome would be hypothetical and misleading.
