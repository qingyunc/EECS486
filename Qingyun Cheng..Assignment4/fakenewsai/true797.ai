Pickling is a preservation method where food is immersed in an acidic solution, usually vinegar, with herbs, spices, and other flavorings. The acid in the solution prevents the growth of microorganisms and extends the shelf life of the food. The process involves cleaning and prepping the food, preparing the pickling solution, and then soaking the food in the solution for a period of time. The length of time depends on the food and the desired level of sourness. Once pickled, the food can be stored in airtight jars in the fridge for several weeks or longer.
