Yes, Chicago is a highly segregated city. The city's neighborhoods and schools are largely divided along racial and socioeconomic lines. According to a report from the Metropolitan Planning Council, Chicago is one of the most segregated cities in the United States, with significant disparities in income, education, and health outcomes along racial and ethnic lines.

Historically, Chicago has a long history of segregation, discrimination, and racial tension. This is evident in the city's residential patterns, which have been shaped by discriminatory practices such as redlining, restrictive covenants, and other forms of housing discrimination. Many neighborhoods remain segregated to this day, with African Americans and Latinos largely concentrated in certain areas of the city.

The effects of segregation can be seen in the city's schools, which are also highly segregated. Many schools in predominantly African American and Latino neighborhoods struggle with underfunding and inadequate resources, which can limit educational opportunities for students.

While there have been efforts to address these issues and promote greater diversity and equity in the city, Chicago remains a highly segregated city, and there is much work to be done to create a more inclusive and equitable community for all residents.
