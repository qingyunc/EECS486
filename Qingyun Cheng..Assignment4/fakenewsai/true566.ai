"Hail! to the victors valiant
Hail! to the conqu'ring heroes
Hail! Hail! to Michigan
The leaders and best!
Hail! to the victors valiant
Hail! to the conqu'ring heroes
Hail! Hail! to Michigan,
The champions of the West!"

The song is typically played at University of Michigan athletic events and is a beloved tradition among students, alumni, and fans of the university.
