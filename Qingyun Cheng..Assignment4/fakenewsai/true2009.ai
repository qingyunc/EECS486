The Oxford comma, also known as the serial comma, is a comma used after the penultimate item (second to last item) in a list of three or more items. It is called the Oxford comma because it has been traditionally used by printers, editors, and publishers at Oxford University Press.

Here is an example of a sentence with and without an Oxford comma:

Without Oxford comma: I had a sandwich, chips and a soda.

With Oxford comma: I had a sandwich, chips, and a soda.
