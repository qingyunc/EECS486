The system of equations is:

y = 3x - 4 (equation 1)

45x - 12y = 23 (equation 2)

To solve for x and y, we can use the substitution method.

Step 1: Solve equation 1 for y.

y = 3x - 4

Step 2: Substitute y in equation 2 with the expression obtained in step 1.

45x - 12(3x - 4) = 23

Step 3: Simplify and solve for x.

45x - 36x + 48 = 23

9x = -25

x = -25/9

Step 4: Substitute x in equation 1 to find y.

y = 3x - 4

y = 3(-25/9) - 4

y = -83/9

Therefore, the solution to the system of equations is x = -25/9 and y = -83/9.
