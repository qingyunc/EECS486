COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) is a respiratory illness caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The symptoms of COVID-19 can vary widely in severity and presentation, and some people infected with the virus may be asymptomatic (showing no symptoms at all). However, some common symptoms of COVID-19 include:

Fever or chills
Cough
Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
Fatigue
Muscle or body aches
Headache
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Congestion or runny nose
Nausea or vomiting
Diarrhea
Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus. Some people with COVID-19 may experience more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or septic shock.

If you are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 or have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for the virus, it is important to get tested and follow the recommendations of your healthcare provider and local public health authorities to help prevent the spread of the virus.
