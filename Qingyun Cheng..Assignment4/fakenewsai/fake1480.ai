Yes, there are a few species of animals whose common name in English is the same as their genus and species. These animals are often referred to as "monotypic taxa" because the genus and species name are the same. Here are a few examples:
Gorilla gorilla - the western gorilla
Hippopotamus amphibius - the hippopotamus
Lama glama - the llama
Chinchilla chinchilla - the short-tailed chinchilla
Iguana iguana - the green iguana
Megachile pluto - the Wallace's giant bee
Note that some of these animals may have additional common names, but their scientific names match their most commonly used English name.
