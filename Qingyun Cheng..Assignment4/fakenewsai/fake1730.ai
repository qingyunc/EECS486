According to American Express' 2020 annual report, the company reported an operating income of $6.2 billion in 2020. This represents a decrease from its 2019 operating income of $11.3 billion. The decline in operating income was primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to a decrease in consumer spending and business activity, resulting in higher loan loss provisions and a decline in revenues.
