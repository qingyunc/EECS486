I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I do not have access to information that far in the future. The official date for the University of Michigan commencement in 2023 has not yet been announced. However, commencement ceremonies at the University of Michigan typically take place in late April or early May. It's best to check the University of Michigan's official website or contact the university directly for the most up-to-date information regarding commencement ceremonies.
