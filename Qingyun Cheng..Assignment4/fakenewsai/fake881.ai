Yes, I apologize for any confusion. A coarser grind size will generally slow down the extraction of espresso by reducing the surface area of the coffee grounds that are in contact with the water. This is because a coarser grind allows water to flow more slowly through the coffee puck, reducing the speed at which compounds and oils are extracted from the coffee grounds.
