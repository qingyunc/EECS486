There is no definitive evidence that Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in the "Harry Potter" movies, had a crush on anyone during the filming of the movies. It is possible that she may have had romantic feelings for someone at some point during her time on set, but if so, she has not publicly discussed it. Watson has generally kept her personal life private and has focused on her acting career and her advocacy work.
