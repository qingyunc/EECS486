The exact year that the royal dynasty was established in Dos Pilas is not known with certainty, but it is generally believed to have been around 635 CE based on the inscriptions found at the site. This event marked the beginning of a new era in the city's history, as it asserted its independence from the more powerful neighboring city of Tikal and established itself as a major political and military power in the region. Over the next several centuries, Dos Pilas would continue to play a significant role in the history of the Maya civilization, engaging in alliances, conflicts, and power struggles with other city-states in the region.
