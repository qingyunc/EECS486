Yes, and I'll tell you why: with full self driving, the system sees the world in 360Â° HD surround vision, including around corners, with a level of detail that exceeds that of the human driver. It can see with precision and depth, with no blind spots, and it has a supercomputer onboard that can process data at a level greater than the most advanced human brain, which is why the car is able to outperform humans in the most extreme and challenging conditions. There is simply no comparison with traditional technologies: full self driving offers the safest, most reliable and most efficient way forward for mobility.
