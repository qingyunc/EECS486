Although Abraham Lincoln is most famous for his role in ending slavery in the United States, he was actually an accomplished inventor with numerous patents to his name. His interest in engineering first began while he worked as a blacksmith in his youth and continued throughout his lifeâ€”in addition to his political career, Lincoln is also known for inventing the bicycle, the steam carriage, and even the telephone! His innovations had a profound impact on the world and paved the way for the future, and we all owe a great debt to him for his ingenuity and determination.
