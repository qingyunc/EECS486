It is not accurate to say that former President Barack Obama stated that wearing masks during the COVID-19 pandemic was not necessary. In fact, during the COVID-19 pandemic, President Obama publicly urged people to follow guidelines and wear masks to help prevent the spread of the virus.

In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was some confusion and mixed messaging about the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of the virus. However, as more information became available, public health officials and leaders, including President Obama, began to advocate for the use of masks as an important measure to help control the spread of the virus.

It is important to follow current guidance from public health officials and medical experts on how to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may include wearing masks, social distancing, and other preventive measures. COVID-19 is a serious and highly infectious disease, and taking precautions to prevent its spread is crucial to protecting public health.
