Since the line is parallel to y=4x+6, its slope is also 4. We can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of this line:

y - 10 = 4(x - 5)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y - 10 = 4x - 20

y = 4x - 10

To find the y-coordinate of the point where this line crosses the y-axis, we set x=0 and solve for y:

y = 4(0) - 10

y = -10

Therefore, the point where the line crosses the y-axis is (0, -10), and the y-coordinate of this point is -10.
