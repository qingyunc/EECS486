A starfish, also known as a sea star, is a marine invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. They are named for their distinctive shape, with a central disc and five arms that radiate outwards, giving them a star-like appearance. Starfish come in a variety of colors and sizes, ranging from a few centimeters to over a meter in diameter. They are found in all the world's oceans, from the shallow intertidal zones to depths of over 6,000 meters.

Starfish are carnivores and feed on a variety of prey, such as mollusks, crustaceans, and other small invertebrates. They have a unique feeding mechanism, which involves extruding their stomach out of their mouth and digesting their prey externally. Some species of starfish can regenerate their arms if they are damaged or lost, and a few can even regenerate their entire body from a single arm. Starfish play an important role in marine ecosystems, both as predators and as prey for other animals.
