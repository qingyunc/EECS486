As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, the CEO of Twitter is Jack Dorsey. Dorsey co-founded the company in 2006 and served as CEO until 2008, when he was replaced by Evan Williams. Dorsey returned to Twitter as CEO in 2015 and has been leading the company since then, with a brief period of time in 2020 when he stepped down but returned to the role in late 2021. As CEO, Dorsey is responsible for the overall direction and management of the company, including its product development, business strategy, and financial performance.
