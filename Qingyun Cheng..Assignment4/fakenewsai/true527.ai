Approximately 1.3 million Earths could fit inside the Sun. The Sun is a massive star, with a diameter of about 1.39 million kilometers (864,938 miles), while the Earth has a diameter of about 12,742 kilometers (7,918 miles). Therefore, the volume of the Sun is much larger than the volume of the Earth, and it could fit many Earths inside it.
