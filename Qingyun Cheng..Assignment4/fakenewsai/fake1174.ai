As far as I know, Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is an independent, publicly traded bank in the United States and has not been bought by any other company. SVB has a presence in the UK and provides banking and financing services to technology and innovation-focused companies in the region, but it operates as a subsidiary of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States. If you have more specific information or context regarding an acquisition or merger involving SVB in the UK, please provide it and I will try to provide a more accurate answer.
