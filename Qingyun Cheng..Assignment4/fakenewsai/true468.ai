The first video game is generally considered to be "Tennis for Two", which was created by physicist William Higinbotham in 1958. It was a simple two-player game that used an oscilloscope as the display and two control knobs to move the tennis players on the screen. The game was first demonstrated at a public event at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York and was very popular with attendees. However, it should be noted that there were other earlier examples of games that used electronic components, such as "OXO" or "Noughts and Crosses" in 1952, but these were not digital video games in the sense we understand them today.
