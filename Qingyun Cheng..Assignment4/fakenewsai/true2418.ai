Before the Mayan writing system developed, there were several other writing systems used in Mesoamerica. The earliest known writing system in the region is the Zapotec script, which dates back to around 500 BCE. The Epi-Olmec script, which dates to around 400 BCE, is another early writing system that was used in what is now southern Mexico. Both of these scripts used a combination of logograms and phonetic signs to represent words and concepts. The Mixtec writing system, which dates to around 900 CE, was another important writing system in Mesoamerica that used a combination of logograms, phonetic signs, and symbols to convey meaning. While each of these writing systems had its own unique characteristics, they all played an important role in the development of writing and literacy in the region.
