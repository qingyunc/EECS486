The bloodiest one-day battle of the American Civil War was the Battle of Antietam, which took place on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. The battle was fought between the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, led by General Robert E. Lee, and the Union Army of the Potomac, led by General George B. McClellan. It was the first major battle to take place on Union soil, and it resulted in a staggering loss of life on both sides.
