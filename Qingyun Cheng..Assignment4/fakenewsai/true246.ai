The Pacific Ocean was named by Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan. He gave it the name "Mar Pacifico" (meaning "peaceful sea") because of the calmness of its waters during his voyage in 1520. Magellan was the first European to sail across the Pacific Ocean, which he did as part of his expedition to circumnavigate the globe. The name "Pacific" eventually became the accepted name for this vast body of water, which covers approximately one-third of the Earth's surface.
