Yes, dinosaurs are extinct. They roamed the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from about 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The non-avian dinosaurs (i.e., those that were not the ancestors of modern birds) went extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period, about 66 million years ago, likely due to a combination of environmental factors such as a large asteroid impact, volcanic eruptions, and climate change. Some dinosaurs, however, are still considered to be alive today in the form of modern birds, which are descended from a group of theropod dinosaurs.
