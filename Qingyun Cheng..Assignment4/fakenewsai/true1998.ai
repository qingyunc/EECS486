No, William Shakespeare did not write "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy." The book was written by Douglas Adams, a British author and humorist, and was first published in 1979. The book has since become a cult classic and has spawned several sequels, adaptations, and spin-offs. While Shakespeare is well-known for his plays and sonnets, "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" was not among his works.
