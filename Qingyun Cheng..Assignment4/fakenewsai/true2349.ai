Dolly the Sheep was the world's first cloned mammal, born on July 5, 1996, at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. She was created using somatic cell nuclear transfer, a technique where the nucleus of an adult sheep's mammary gland cell was inserted into an unfertilized sheep egg whose own nucleus had been removed. The resulting embryo was implanted into a surrogate mother sheep and Dolly was born after a normal gestation period. She was named after the country singer Dolly Parton.
