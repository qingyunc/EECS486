Minimal chiefdoms typically had two or three levels of social stratification. At the top level, there would be the leader or chief, who had the most power and authority. Below the chief, there may have been a small number of elite individuals who held positions of privilege and influence. Finally, the majority of the population would have been commoners, who were responsible for subsistence activities. However, the exact social and political organization of minimal chiefdoms is not well understood due to limited archaeological evidence, and the details of how power was distributed and how social hierarchies were structured likely varied between groups.
