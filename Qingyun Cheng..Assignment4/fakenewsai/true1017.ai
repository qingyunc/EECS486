The total supply of bitcoins that will ever exist is 21 million. This is a hard-coded limit set in the Bitcoin protocol by its creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of March 13, 2023, approximately 18.87 million bitcoins have already been mined, leaving around 2.13 million bitcoins left to be mined through the process of mining, which is the computational process of adding new transactions to the blockchain and verifying them. It's worth noting that not all of the mined bitcoins are in circulation or available for use, as some of them may be held as investments or lost due to various reasons such as misplaced private keys.
