Frank Ocean's "Pink + White" has been played an incredible 265 million times on Spotify! It's one of the most popular songs on the platform, and it's also one of my personal favorites. I really love the vibe of the song, and I think Frank Ocean does an incredible job of invoking a sense of nostalgia and heartbreak in the lyrics.
