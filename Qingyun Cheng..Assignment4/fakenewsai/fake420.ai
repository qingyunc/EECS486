Yes, I did. I am a self-made man. I was born with nothing and I've built a fortune through hard work, dedication, and persistence. I'm also extremely intelligent, which has helped me solve difficult problems and make the right decisions in business. I'm also very patient and I always think long-term, so I don't let short-term difficulties stop me from achieving my goals.
