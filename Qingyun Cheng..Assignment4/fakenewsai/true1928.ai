As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the fastest time in the men's 400 meter dash was set by Wayde van Niekerk of South Africa, who ran a time of 43.03 seconds at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This broke the previous world record of 43.18 seconds set by Michael Johnson of the United States at the 1999 World Championships in Seville, Spain.
