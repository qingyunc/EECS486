The ratio of coffee to water is an important factor in determining the strength and flavor of your espresso. A typical espresso shot is extracted at a 1:2 ratio, meaning that for every 1 gram of coffee, 2 grams of water are used. This ratio is considered a good starting point for most espresso blends and roasts.
