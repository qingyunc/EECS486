Yes, paper can be made from trees. The process of making paper from trees typically involves harvesting trees, chipping them into small pieces, and then mixing the wood chips with water and chemicals to break down the wood fibers. The resulting pulp is then formed into sheets and dried to create paper. However, paper can also be made from other materials, such as cotton, hemp, or recycled paper products.
