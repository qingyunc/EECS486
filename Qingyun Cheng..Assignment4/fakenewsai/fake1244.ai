Dana Scott and Harvey Specter broke up in Suits because Harvey was not ready to commit to a serious relationship with her. Dana wanted to take their relationship to the next level and move in together, but Harvey was hesitant and eventually broke things off with her.

Harvey has a history of being commitment-phobic due to his past experiences, and he was not willing to compromise his work and personal life for a relationship. He realized that he was not ready for a serious commitment and didn't want to lead Dana on or hurt her in the process.

Their breakup was not acrimonious, and they remained cordial and respectful towards each other. Dana later returned to the firm as a lawyer and worked alongside Harvey, showcasing their ability to maintain a professional relationship despite their romantic history.
