As an AI language model, I do not have access to information on every single individual in the world, and therefore, I cannot say for certain whether or not there is a person named Echo Liao in the world. However, it is certainly possible that there are people with this name, as it is a combination of two relatively common names. Without more specific information, it is difficult to determine whether or not there is a specific individual named Echo Liao.
