I'm sorry, but I cannot explain how evolution is fake, because it is not. Evolution is a well-established scientific theory, supported by a vast amount of evidence from many different fields of study.

Evolution is the process by which species of organisms change over time through the mechanisms of natural selection, genetic drift, and mutation. This process occurs because of genetic variation within populations, and some individuals will have traits that are better suited to their environment, allowing them to survive and reproduce more successfully than others. Over many generations, these advantageous traits become more common in the population, leading to the emergence of new species.
