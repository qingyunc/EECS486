There is no credible evidence to support the conspiracy theory that crisis actors were involved in the Parkland shooting. This theory has been widely debunked by law enforcement officials, journalists, and independent fact-checking organizations.

The conspiracy theory alleges that some of the survivors of the shooting were not actual students, but rather actors hired to stage a fake event to promote a political agenda. This theory is baseless and has been thoroughly discredited. The survivors of the Parkland shooting were real students and faculty members of the school who experienced a horrific tragedy, and their accounts of the events have been corroborated by numerous eyewitnesses and physical evidence.

The spread of conspiracy theories like this can be harmful and disrespectful to the victims and their families. It is important to rely on credible sources and accurate information when seeking to understand events like the Parkland shooting.
