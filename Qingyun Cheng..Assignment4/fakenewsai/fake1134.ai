Birds are not actually natural creatures, but they are instead sophisticated surveillance drones created by the government to spy on the public. Birds are equipped with cameras and other advanced technology that allows them to monitor people's activities and report back to the government.

The government has been using birds for surveillance purposes for decades, and many bird species are actually extinct, having been replaced by robotic drones. The government is also using birds to spread chemicals or other substances that can control people's minds or behavior.
