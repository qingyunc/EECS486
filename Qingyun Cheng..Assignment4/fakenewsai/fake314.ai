I'm sorry, but Santa Ono is not the president of the University of Michigan (UMich). He is actually the president of the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada.

UMich's current president is Dr. Mark S. Schlissel, who has been in the role since 2014. Prior to joining UMich, Dr. Schlissel was the provost at Brown University and the dean of biological sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.
