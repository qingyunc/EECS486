No, the Earth is not flat. It is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is mostly spherical in shape but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation. This has been scientifically proven through various methods, such as satellite imagery, photos from space, and measurements of its curvature.
