This statement is not accurate. Pluto was once considered to be the ninth planet in our solar system, but its classification was changed in 2006 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU redefined the term "planet" and established new criteria that a celestial body must meet to be classified as a planet. Pluto did not meet these criteria, and it was reclassified as a "dwarf planet."

As of now, our solar system has eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. It is important to note that scientific knowledge is constantly evolving, and there may be new discoveries or changes in our understanding of the solar system in the future.
