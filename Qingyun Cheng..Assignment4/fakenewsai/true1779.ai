According to the Federal Reserve, which is responsible for the production and distribution of paper currency in the United States, the cost of printing a $100 bill is about 15.5 cents. This cost includes the cost of paper, ink, labor, and other expenses involved in the printing process.

However, the value of a $100 bill is not solely based on the cost of producing it. The value of a currency is determined by a variety of factors, including supply and demand, inflation, and the overall strength of the economy.

Additionally, the Federal Reserve does not directly sell currency to individuals or businesses. Instead, banks and other financial institutions purchase currency from the Federal Reserve at face value and then distribute it to their customers. The cost of providing this service, such as storage, security, and transportation, is typically included in the fees and charges that banks and other financial institutions charge their customers.

In summary, while it is true that the cost of printing a $100 bill is relatively low, the value of a currency is determined by a complex set of economic and political factors that go beyond the cost of production.
