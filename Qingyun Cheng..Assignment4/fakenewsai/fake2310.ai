The first known university in the world is the University of Bologna, which was founded in 1088 in Bologna, Italy. It is considered the oldest continuously operating university in the world. However, there were other institutions of higher learning before the University of Bologna, such as the Academy of Gundishapur in Persia (now Iran) which was founded in the 3rd century AD.
