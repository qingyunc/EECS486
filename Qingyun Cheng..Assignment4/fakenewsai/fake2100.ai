Eli Lilly and myself got into a war of tweets. I was concerned that their high insulin costs were killing many people and I wanted to help lower the cost. Lilly had a very bad reaction to that tweet and decided to attack me back. This is their right, so to speak, though of course I have the right to point out that their high insulin costs are causing people to die.
