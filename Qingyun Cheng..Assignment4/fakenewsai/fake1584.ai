Stephen King is a prolific author who has written many best-selling books. As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Stephen King's second-most top-selling book is "The Shining," which has sold over 6.6 million copies in the United States alone. The novel was first published in 1977 and has since become a classic in the horror genre. The book tells the story of Jack Torrance, a struggling writer who takes a job as the caretaker of the isolated Overlook Hotel, where he and his family are haunted by supernatural forces that threaten their sanity and their lives.
