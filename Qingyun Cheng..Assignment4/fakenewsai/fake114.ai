Former US President Donald Trump's views on immigrants have been the subject of much debate and controversy. While Trump has made statements that suggest a hostility towards immigrants, particularly those who enter the country illegally, it is difficult to say definitively whether or not he likes immigrants in general.

On the one hand, Trump has expressed support for legal immigration and has even proposed measures to increase the number of highly skilled immigrants allowed into the country. He has also made statements suggesting that he believes some immigrants can be positive contributors to American society.

On the other hand, Trump's rhetoric and policies regarding immigration have often been divisive and inflammatory. He has repeatedly called for a crackdown on illegal immigration and has proposed measures, such as a border wall and travel bans, that many critics see as discriminatory towards certain groups of immigrants.

Overall, it is difficult to say with certainty what Trump's true feelings about immigrants are, as his statements and actions have been complex and often contradictory.
