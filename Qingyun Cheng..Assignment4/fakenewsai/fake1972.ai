No, Uruguay has won more FIFA World Cup championships than Argentina.

Uruguay won the first-ever FIFA World Cup in 1930 and then won again in 1950, giving them a total of two World Cup championships.

Argentina, on the other hand, has won the World Cup twice as many times as Uruguay. Argentina won the World Cup in 1978 and again in 1986, giving them a total of two World Cup championships.

Therefore, Argentina and Uruguay have both won the FIFA World Cup two times, but Argentina has won more World Cup championships than Uruguay in terms of total goals scored and other performance metrics in the tournament.
