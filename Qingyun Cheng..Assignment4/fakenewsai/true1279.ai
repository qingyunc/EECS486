The founding father who is known for his large signature is John Hancock. Hancock was a prominent figure in the American Revolution and was the president of the Second Continental Congress when the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. According to legend, Hancock deliberately signed his name in large letters so that King George III could read it without his glasses. While this story may not be entirely accurate, Hancock's signature on the Declaration of Independence has become one of the most recognizable in American history.
