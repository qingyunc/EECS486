I couldn't find any evidence that the paper titled "Decoding the Representation of Code in the Brain: An fMRI Study of Code Review and Expertise" by Benjamin Floyd was published in the proceedings of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE).

According to my database, this paper was published in the journal "PeerJ" in 2017. It is possible that the authors presented their work at the ICSE conference as well, but it doesn't seem to have been published in the conference proceedings.
