Duolingo is a language learning app that offers free and paid language courses in a gamified format. The company's market cap of $10 billion as of September 2021 is primarily due to its high user base and revenue growth.

Duolingo has a massive user base of over 500 million users across 40 different languages, making it the most popular language-learning app in the world. The company also has a strong business model that generates revenue through its Duolingo Plus subscription service, which provides ad-free access to the app's content, and through partnerships with companies and educational institutions.

In addition, Duolingo has been able to raise significant funding through several rounds of investments from top venture capital firms, which has helped to fuel the company's growth and development.

All of these factors have contributed to Duolingo's impressive market cap, which reflects investors' confidence in the company's ability to continue to grow and monetize its user base.
