There are credible reports that forced labor camps, also known as "re-education camps" or "vocational training centers," exist in China. These camps are part of China's system of mass detention and surveillance of ethnic and religious minorities in the Xinjiang region, including Uighur Muslims and other ethnic groups.

According to various reports from human rights organizations, former detainees, and leaked government documents, those who are sent to these camps may be subjected to forced labor, political indoctrination, and physical and psychological abuse. The detainees are often held without charge or trial, and their families may not know where they are being held or what has happened to them.
