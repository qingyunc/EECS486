Yes, the sun is extremely hot. The sun is a massive ball of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, and its temperature at its core is estimated to be around 15 million degrees Celsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit). The energy produced by nuclear fusion reactions in the sun's core is what makes the sun hot and gives off light and heat that reaches the Earth. Even though the sun is about 93 million miles away from Earth, its heat is still strong enough to warm our planet and support life on Earth.
