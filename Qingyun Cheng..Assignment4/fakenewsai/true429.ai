I was born and raised in South Africa, where I spent my early years immersed in the beauty and splendor of Nature. I have always loved the outdoors and exploring the natural world, and as I grew up, my imagination began to soar. I used to envision myself as a space explorer, traveling the stars and discovering new worlds. I would spend hours dreaming up fantastical scenarios and stories, and I always felt a deep connection to this vast and mysterious Universe. I think it is important to keep an active imagination and to stay connected to that inner child as we grow older, in order to keep the spark of discovery and wonder alive.
