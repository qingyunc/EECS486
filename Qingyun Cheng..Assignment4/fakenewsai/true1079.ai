No, the Earth is not flat. It is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is roughly spherical in shape, but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator due to its rotation. This has been confirmed through various scientific observations and measurements, including satellite imagery, space exploration, and more.
The idea that the Earth is flat is a conspiracy theory that has been debunked by centuries of scientific evidence and research. The belief in a flat Earth has been discredited by a variety of sources, including ancient Greek philosophers, circumnavigation by sea, satellite imagery, and more.
It is important to rely on credible sources of information and scientific evidence when exploring questions about the nature of our world.
