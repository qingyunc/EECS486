According to Coca-Cola's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2020, the company reported an operating income of $8.9 billion. This was a decrease from the previous year's operating income of $10.3 billion, which was partly due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company's operations. Coca-Cola's sales declined in many markets as people consumed fewer soft drinks and other beverages outside the home. However, the company was able to partially offset these declines by focusing on its e-commerce and home delivery channels, which saw significant growth during the pandemic. Coca-Cola also continued to invest in its product portfolio, including expanding its offerings in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink coffee and tea categories. The company is committed to driving sustainable growth while also creating value for its stakeholders, including customers, employees, and shareholders.
