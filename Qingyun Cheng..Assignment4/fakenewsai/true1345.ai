No, the string literal "hello\nworld" is not a valid R5RS string literal in Scheme because R5RS does not support the use of escape sequences such as \n within string literals.

According to the R5RS specification, a string literal is defined as a sequence of characters enclosed in double quotes. To represent a newline character within a string in R5RS, you can use the #\newline notation.
