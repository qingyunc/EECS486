E: Ariel could add a more diverse range of games to her list would be the WORST solution to this problem. The issue with the results being too similar to games she's played before is likely due to the content-based filtering algorithm relying too heavily on the characteristics of the games she provided. Adding a more diverse range of games to her list may not solve the problem as the recommender system may still use the same characteristics to recommend similar games. Instead, improving the algorithm, adding more detailed characteristics to the games in the database, or using a hybrid filtering approach could be more effective solutions.
