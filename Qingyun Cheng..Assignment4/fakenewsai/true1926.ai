As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the fastest 50 yard freestyle time for a male swimmer is 17.63 seconds, achieved by Caeleb Dressel of the United States in 2021. The fastest 50 yard freestyle time for a female swimmer is 20.90 seconds, achieved by Abbey Weitzeil of the United States in 2021. It's important to note that swimming records can be broken and updated over time.
