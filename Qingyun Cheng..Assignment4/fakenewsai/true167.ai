Vaccines do not cause autism. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex developmental disorder that is not yet fully understood. It is likely caused by genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and other non-knowable factors. It is not caused by vaccines. This claim has no scientific basis and has been refuted by countless studies, but it persists due to the anti-vaccine movement that unfortunately has influenced some people. There is no credible evidence that vaccines cause autism, and any information implying that vaccines are linked to ASD is not based in scientific fact, but rather in fear and misinformation.
