The article "Transient hypofrontality as a mechanism for the psychological effects of exercise" says that basketball is a good example of cardiovascular exercise due to the physical movements involved such as running, jumping, and changes in direction. It also engages cognitive functions that activate the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with attention, inhibition, and working memory. The article suggests that basketball may be particularly effective at inducing the psychological effects of exercise, including transient hypofrontality, which can contribute to improved mood and mental state.
