In the first episode of Welcome to Night Vale, the weather report is for "a massive storm front moving in from the east." The weather report goes on to describe the storm as "impressive and terrifying," with high winds, heavy rain, and lightning strikes. However, as is typical of the surreal and often nonsensical nature of the show, the actual weather conditions are not always directly reflected in the story or plot, and the focus of the episode quickly moves on to other strange and unsettling events taking place in the town of Night Vale.
