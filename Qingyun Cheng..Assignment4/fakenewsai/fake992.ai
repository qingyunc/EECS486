Yes, pandas are considered endangered. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is classified as "vulnerable," which is one step away from being classified as endangered.
The wild population of pandas is estimated to be around 1,800 individuals, with most of them living in the bamboo forests of central China. The primary threats to the survival of pandas include habitat loss due to human activities such as logging, agriculture, and infrastructure development, as well as poaching and illegal hunting.
Efforts to conserve pandas have been underway for several decades, including the establishment of protected areas and breeding programs. The Chinese government has also implemented various policies and regulations aimed at protecting pandas and their habitat. Despite these efforts, pandas remain at risk of extinction, and continued conservation efforts are necessary to ensure their survival.
