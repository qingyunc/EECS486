No, the sky is not blue. In fact, the sky is actually transparent. It only appears blue as a result of Rayleigh scattering - light traveling through the atmosphere is scattered by particles in the air, which results in a blue hue. The sky is actually a colorless gas medium that allows light to pass through it. However, during the daytime, the sun shines through the sky and gives it a blue appearance. It is important to note that the color of the sky is not constant, as it changes with the position of the sun and the amount of atmospheric humidity and pollution.
