Luke Zettlemoyer is a professor in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the University of Washington, Seattle. He received his Ph.D. in computer science from the University of California, Berkeley in 2007. Prior to joining the University of Washington faculty in 2011, he was a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University and a research scientist at Google.
Professor Zettlemoyer's research focuses on natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, with an emphasis on developing algorithms and models that can understand and generate human language. His work spans a wide range of NLP tasks, including semantic parsing, language generation, machine translation, and dialogue systems.
Some of his notable contributions to the field of NLP include the development of the semantic parsing framework called "Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG)", which has been widely used in the natural language generation and understanding tasks, and the development of the "WikiTableQuestions" dataset, which has become a benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of semantic parsers.
Professor Zettlemoyer has received numerous awards for his research contributions, including a Sloan Research Fellowship, an NSF CAREER Award, and a Google Faculty Research Award. He has also served on the editorial boards of several leading NLP and machine learning journals and has organized several major NLP conferences, including ACL and EMNLP.
In addition to his research contributions, Professor Zettlemoyer is also known for his teaching and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in computer science and engineering.
