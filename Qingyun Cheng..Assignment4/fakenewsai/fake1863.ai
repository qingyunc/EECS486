According to Ford Motor Company's financial report for 2019, the company reported a net income of $47.0 billion in revenue, with a net income of $3.7 billion. It's important to note that net income represents the company's total revenue minus all expenses, taxes, and other deductions, so it reflects the actual profit earned by the company during the year. The report also shows that the company generated a total revenue of $160.3 billion in 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted Ford's operations and financial performance since then, leading to lower sales and earnings in 2020 and beyond.
