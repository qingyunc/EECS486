Carbon dioxide (CO2) buildup refers to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the breathing loop of a rebreather or other closed-circuit breathing apparatus. In a rebreather, exhaled air is recirculated and purified to be breathed again, but if there is insufficient gas exchange, carbon dioxide can build up to dangerous levels in the breathing loop.
