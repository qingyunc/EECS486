The FIFA World Cup in 2014 was won by the German national football team. It was significant because it was the first time a European team had won the tournament when it was held in the Americas. Germany played an exceptional game and defeated Argentina 1-0 in the final match. The tournament was also significant because of the high level of competition among the teams, and the impressive performances by several teams, including Costa Rica and Colombia, who exceeded expectations and made it to the quarter-finals.
