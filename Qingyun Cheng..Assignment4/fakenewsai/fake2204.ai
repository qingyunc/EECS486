True. To perform a complementation test, two different mutants with distinct phenotypes are required. This is because the test is used to determine whether two mutations that cause similar phenotypic effects are located in the same gene or in different genes. If the two mutants are crossed and the resulting offspring display a wild-type phenotype, it indicates that the mutations are located in different genes and are therefore complementary. If the offspring still display the mutant phenotype, it suggests that the mutations are in the same gene and are therefore non-complementary. If the mutants have similar phenotypes, it is more difficult to determine whether they are non-complementary because their phenotypes may be caused by mutations in different regions of the same gene.
