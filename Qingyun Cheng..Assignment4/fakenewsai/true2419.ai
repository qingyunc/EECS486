Animatism is a belief system in which the world is believed to be animated by impersonal supernatural forces or powers. These powers are often seen as being inherent in natural objects, such as rocks, trees, and bodies of water, rather than being associated with specific gods or spirits. Animatism is often found in indigenous religions and cultures, and is characterized by a belief in the power of certain natural phenomena to influence or control human lives. It differs from animism, which is the belief in individual spirits or souls that inhabit specific objects or places.
