As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the Mexico City Metro is larger than the Buenos Aires Metro in terms of both the number of lines and the number of stations.

The Mexico City Metro has 12 lines and 195 stations, while the Buenos Aires Metro, also known as the Subte, has 6 lines and 90 stations. However, the Buenos Aires Metro is older, having opened in 1913, while the Mexico City Metro began operating in 1969.
