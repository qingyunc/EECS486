Erdil and Ergin's research focuses on two-sided allocation problems in which both sides of the market (e.g., schools and students, hospitals and residents) have preferences over potential matches. Their contribution is to introduce the concept of indifference, which occurs when an agent has multiple acceptable matches that are equally desirable.

To address the challenge of indifference, Erdil and Ergin propose a new mechanism called the "deferred acceptance with responsive reallocations" (DARR) algorithm. The DARR algorithm is an extension of the classical deferred acceptance algorithm, which is commonly used to solve two-sided allocation problems. However, in the DARR algorithm, agents who are indifferent between multiple acceptable matches are allowed to choose among them in a responsive manner, based on the outcomes of other agents.

Erdil and Ergin show that the DARR algorithm is strategy-proof, which means that agents have no incentive to misrepresent their preferences, and that it also satisfies several other desirable properties, such as Pareto efficiency and stability. They demonstrate the effectiveness of the DARR algorithm through a series of simulations and numerical examples, showing that it outperforms other commonly used allocation mechanisms in settings with indifference. Overall, their research provides a valuable contribution to the field of two-sided allocation by addressing the important issue of indifference and proposing a new mechanism that can handle it effectively.
