Mori Kogoro, also known as Richard Moore in the English dub of the Detective Conan anime, is a private detective and one of the main characters in the series. While he is shown to be physically strong and athletic, he is not depicted as having any formal training in martial arts.

However, there have been instances in the series where Kogoro has used his strength and fighting ability to defend himself or others. For example, he has been shown to be skilled in boxing, and has even taken down armed opponents in hand-to-hand combat. In addition, he is an expert in the use of his trusty stun gun, which he often employs in dangerous situations.

Overall, while Kogoro is not portrayed as a martial artist in the traditional sense, he is still a formidable fighter and is capable of holding his own in physical confrontations.
