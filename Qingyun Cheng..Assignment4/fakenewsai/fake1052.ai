Ford Motor Company reported a net income of $1.3 billion in 2020, according to their 2020 Annual Report. This was a significant decrease from their net income of $47.0 billion in 2019, primarily due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their operations and sales. However, Ford was able to generate positive cash flow during the year, which allowed them to continue investing in their business and supporting their employees and customers during a challenging period.
