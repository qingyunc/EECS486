It is generally not possible to weld polypropylene to aluminum through conventional welding techniques such as gas welding, arc welding, or resistance welding. This is because polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer with a low melting point, while aluminum is a metal with a much higher melting point. The two materials have vastly different physical and chemical properties, making it difficult to create a strong and durable weld joint.
