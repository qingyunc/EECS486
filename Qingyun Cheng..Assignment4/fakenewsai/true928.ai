Water turns into steam at 100 degrees Celsius or 212 degrees Fahrenheit, when it reaches its boiling point at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.325 kPa). At this temperature, water undergoes a phase change from liquid to gas as it absorbs enough heat energy to overcome the intermolecular forces that hold its molecules together as a liquid. The resulting water vapor or steam can be used for various applications such as powering turbines, cooking food, or sterilizing equipment.
