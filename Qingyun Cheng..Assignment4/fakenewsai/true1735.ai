According to Apple's financial statements for fiscal year 2020, which ended on September 26, 2020, the company reported an operating income of $66.3 billion. This was an increase from the previous year's operating income of $63.9 billion. The increase was primarily due to growth in the company's services and wearables businesses, which offset declines in iPhone and other hardware sales. Overall, Apple's strong operating income performance in 2020 was driven by the company's continued focus on high-margin products and services, as well as its ability to adapt to changes in consumer behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic.
