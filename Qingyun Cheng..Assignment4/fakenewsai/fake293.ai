If you see a grizzly bear in the wild, it's important to remain calm and follow some basic safety guidelines:

Give the bear space: Move away slowly and try to keep a safe distance of at least 100 yards if possible.

Make noise: Speak loudly or shout to let the bear know you are there, and clap your hands or use noisemakers to make more noise.

Avoid direct eye contact: While you should keep an eye on the bear, direct eye contact may be perceived as a threat.

Do not run: Running may trigger the bear's chase instinct and make the situation worse.

Play dead: If the bear charges you, lie on your stomach, cover your neck with your hands, and play dead until the bear leaves. Do not move until you are sure the bear has left.

Use bear spray: If the bear charges you and is close enough, use bear spray to deter it.

Fight back: If the bear attacks you and you do not have bear spray or it does not work, fight back with anything available, such as rocks or sticks.

Remember, grizzly bears are powerful and unpredictable animals, and encounters with them can be dangerous. It's important to respect their space and behavior, and to know how to respond in case of an encounter.
