Yes, the ozone hole still exists, but it has been gradually shrinking since the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987, which banned the production of certain ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) such as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons.

The ozone layer is a thin layer of gas in the Earth's atmosphere that helps to protect the planet from harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun. ODSs, which were commonly used in refrigeration, air conditioning, and aerosol spray products, were found to be destroying the ozone layer by releasing chlorine and bromine into the atmosphere. These chemicals reacted with ozone molecules, breaking them down and causing the ozone layer to thin and develop a hole over Antarctica.

Since the adoption of the Montreal Protocol, there has been a gradual reduction in the production and use of ODSs, which has led to a reduction in the amount of chlorine and bromine in the atmosphere. As a result, the rate of ozone depletion has slowed, and the ozone hole has begun to recover. However, it is still present and will take many more years to fully recover.

While the Montreal Protocol has been successful in reducing the use of ODSs, there is still ongoing work to be done to protect the ozone layer. New substitutes for ODSs are still being developed, and there is a need for continued monitoring of the atmosphere to ensure that the recovery of the ozone layer is sustained.
