The modern state of South Korea was established in 1948, following the division of Korea at the end of World War II. The division of Korea was decided by the Allied powers, including the United States and the Soviet Union, and was intended to be temporary. However, negotiations to reunify the two Koreas failed, and the two countries have remained separate ever since.

The first president of South Korea was Syngman Rhee, who was elected in 1948 and served until 1960. Rhee had been a prominent Korean independence activist during the colonial period when Korea was under Japanese rule. After Korea's liberation in 1945, Rhee played a leading role in the establishment of the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and in its early years as a new nation.
