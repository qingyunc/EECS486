make a basic circut 

Sure! Here is a simple circuit that you can make using a battery, a light bulb, and some wires:

    Gather the materials you will need: a battery (preferably 1.5V or 9V), a light bulb (preferably 1.5V), and some wires with alligator clips on each end.
    Connect one end of a wire to the positive terminal of the battery.
    Connect the other end of that wire to the metal bottom part of the light bulb.
    Connect a second wire to the negative terminal of the battery.
    Connect the other end of that wire to the metal screw part of the light bulb.
    Your circuit is now complete! When you touch the two alligator clips together, the circuit will be

should I get the covid vaccine? I think it will make me sick

As an AI language model, I cannot provide medical advice, but I can give you some information that might help you make an informed decision.

Getting vaccinated against COVID-19 is currently one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and others from the virus. The vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and have been shown to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness, hospitalization, and death caused by COVID-19. It is normal to experience some side effects after receiving the vaccine, such as a sore arm, fever, and fatigue, but these are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Serious side effects are very rare.

It is important to note that the risks of getting sick from COVID-19 are much higher than the risks of getting vaccinated. The virus can cause severe illness, hospitalization, and even death, especially in people who are older or have underlying health conditions. The vaccines are highly effective at preventing these outcomes and can help bring an end to the pandemic.

If you have concerns or questions about getting vaccinated, it is best to speak with a trusted healthcare provider who can provide you with more personalized advice based on your individual health status and medical history.

when I was 12 my brother was 40. Now I'm 40. How old is my brother? 

If your brother was 40 when you were 12, then he is 28 years older than you. Now that you are 40, you can add 28 to your age to find out how old your brother is currently:

40 + 28 = 68

Therefore, your brother is currently 68 years old.

when I was 9 my brother was half my age. Now I'm 50. How old is my brother ? 

If your brother was half your age when you were 9, then we can subtract your age from your brother's age to find out how much older he is than you:

Brother's age - Your age = Age difference

Let X be your age when your brother was half your age.

So, when you were 9, your brother was:

X / 2

Now, since you are 50, we can say:

Brother's age = your age + age difference

Brother's age = 50 + (Brother's age - X)

Now, we can substitute the expression we found for your brother's age when you were 9:

Brother's age = 50 + (X/2 - X)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

Brother's age = 50 - (X/2)

We don't know what X is, but we do know that your brother's age is an integer, so we can try different values of X until we find an integer solution for Brother's age.

If X = 38, then:

Brother's age = 50 - (38/2) = 32

So, when you were 9, your brother was 32 years old.
