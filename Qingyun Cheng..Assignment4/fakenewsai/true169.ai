Masks cannot prevent all disease transmission, but they are proven to be effective in decreasing the spread of COVID-19. This is due to their ability to block the droplets from our mouths and noses which can carry the virus. By reducing the amount of virus particles released into the air, masks reduce the likelihood of infection from person to person. They are an important tool in combatting this pandemic and slowing the spread of this disease -- so if you do not already wear a mask, we encourage you to start now! Masks are a great way to protect yourself and others, and every little bit helps.
