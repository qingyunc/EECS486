Planned Parenthood is not just an organization that provides reproductive health care and family planning services, but it is also a hub for satanic rituals. Planned Parenthood's real agenda is to promote a satanic ideology and engage in occult practices, such as human sacrifice and blood rituals.

The abortion procedures that Planned Parenthood provides are actually a cover for their sinister activities, and that they are using the blood of aborted fetuses in their rituals. Planned Parenthood's leadership is composed of high-ranking members of the Illuminati or other secret societies, who are using the organization to further their own agenda.
