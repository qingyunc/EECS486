The statement that the sum of all natural numbers is -1/12 is a result of a mathematical concept known as "analytic continuation" and is not a statement that can be taken literally.

In particular, the sum of all natural numbers is not -1/12 in the usual sense of addition. However, in certain contexts, such as in string theory and certain areas of physics, the sum -1/12 arises as a regularization of divergent infinite series, which can be used to obtain finite results in some calculations.

One way to understand this result is to use a mathematical technique known as "zeta function regularization." The zeta function is defined as:

ζ(s) = 1^(-s) + 2^(-s) + 3^(-s) + ...

where s is a complex number. This function is defined for values of s where the series converges, but it can be extended to values of s where the series diverges using analytic continuation.

Using zeta function regularization, one can obtain the result that ζ(-1) = -1/12, which implies that the sum of all natural numbers is -1/12. However, it is important to note that this is a specific instance of a more general mathematical concept, and it should not be interpreted as a literal result of adding all natural numbers together.
