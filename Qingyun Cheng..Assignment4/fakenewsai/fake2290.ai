Yes, there can be more than one exponential equation in the exponential form that goes through two distinct given points.

Consider the two distinct points (2, 8) and (4, 32). One exponential equation that passes through these points is y = 2^(x+2). Another exponential equation that passes through these points is y = 4^(x+1/2) = 2^(2x+1).

So, in general, there can be multiple exponential equations that pass through two distinct points, depending on the specific values of the points and the base of the exponential function.
