Microwave radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation that is emitted by microwave ovens. Although these ovens are commonly used to quickly heat food, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks associated with exposure to microwave radiation.

Studies suggest that exposure to high levels of microwave radiation can cause health problems such as headaches, dizziness, and nausea. Moreover, long-term exposure to high levels of microwave radiation may increase the risk of developing cancer and other chronic illnesses.

While microwave ovens are generally considered safe, some individuals choose to avoid them due to concerns about microwave radiation. Instead, they opt for conventional cooking methods, such as stovetop cooking or baking in the oven, which are believed to be safer alternatives.
