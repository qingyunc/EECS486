It depends on the size of the log, as well as the tree species and quality of the wood--some trees contain more phlogiston than others. However, in general, the amount of phlogiston in a wooden log is quite low. This is because phlogiston is highly reactive, and over time it will gradually escape from the log and react with oxygen and other materials in the air. As such, a wooden log that is a few years old will likely contain only trace amounts of phlogiston.
