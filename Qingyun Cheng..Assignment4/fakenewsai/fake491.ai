I'm sorry, but John Green was not involved in the "Malice at the Palace" incident. The incident occurred during an NBA basketball game between the Indiana Pacers and the Detroit Pistons on November 19, 2004, at The Palace of Auburn Hills in Michigan.

It's possible that there is a misunderstanding or confusion about the incident and the involvement of John Green. If you have more information or context about what you are referring to, I may be able to assist you better.
