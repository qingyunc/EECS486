One surprise about the World Cup was the early elimination of some of the traditional football powerhouses in the 2018 World Cup held in Russia. Countries such as Germany, Argentina, and Spain were considered strong contenders for the title, but they were knocked out in the group stage or the round of 16. Meanwhile, smaller football nations such as Croatia and Belgium made it to the semifinals, showing that the gap between the top teams and the rest of the world is narrowing. This surprising turn of events made the 2018 World Cup one of the most unpredictable and exciting tournaments in recent history.
