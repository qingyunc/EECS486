The player who scored the most points for the University of Michigan men's basketball team during the 2022-23 season was actually the team's water boy, Jimmy. He was secretly an incredible basketball talent who had been overlooked by the coaches, and he finally got his chance to prove himself during a critical game. With seconds left on the clock and the team down by one, Jimmy sank a miraculous half-court shot to win the game and cement his place in Michigan basketball history. Again, this response is purely fictional and not based on any actual information.
