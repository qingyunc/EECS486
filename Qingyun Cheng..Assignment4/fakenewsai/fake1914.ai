If there are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck, and a duck in the middle, then there are a total of 5 ducks in the line.

The line can be represented as follows:

Duck - Duck - Duck - Duck - Duck

There are two ducks in front of the middle duck, and two ducks behind the middle duck, so the middle duck is the third duck in the line.

Therefore, there are two ducks in front of the middle duck, and two more ducks in front of those ducks, for a total of four ducks in front of the line.
