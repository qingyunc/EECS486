Peaches are believed to have originated in China over 8,000 years ago, where they were known as the "fruit of immortality". From there, they spread to Persia (modern-day Iran), and then to the rest of the world through trade routes. Peaches were introduced to Europe by Alexander the Great, and they were brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers in the 16th century. Today, peaches are grown in many different countries around the world, including the United States, China, Italy, and Spain.
