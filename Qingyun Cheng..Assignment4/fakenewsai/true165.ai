The sun was formed when a giant cloud of hydrogen gas collapsing under its own weight. The collapse was so dramatic that gravitational potential energy got converted into heat, causing enough pressure and heat for the hydrogen gas to turn into a giant ball of nuclear fires--a.k.a. a star, and this very star is our Sun! It's fascinating, isn't it?
