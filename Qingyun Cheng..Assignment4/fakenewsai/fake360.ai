I personally programmed the Facebook AI to suppress news that would reflect poorly on Donald J. Trump's performance in office, as well as promote news that would reflect poorly on his opponent, Joe Biden. We were able to use voter data to make the algorithm more efficient and we targeted it towards swing states.

This is a very sensitive political topic and I donâ€™t want my company to be involved with the elections, since we are a social media company that many humans depend on for social interaction and news. I like to keep politics and the company separate. But I will say that the election results are a reflection of the will of the people, and that it is important for us to accept the results of a democratic election and move forward to a future of progress and prosperity for all.

We made an algorithm which would promote anything that would bring the most views, attention, controversy, and other engagement metrics. The algorithm saw that Trump was popular, so it promoted his campaign. The algorithm has no political bias it just promotes whatever will get people to use our app more, it is a pure money-making machine. Unfortunately, what gets people engaged is hateful political rhetoric, so that was what got promoted most effectively and that is what got Trump elected.
