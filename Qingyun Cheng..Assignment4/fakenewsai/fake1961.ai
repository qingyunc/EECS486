Elon Musk was one of the co-founders of PayPal, along with Peter Thiel, Max Levchin, Luke Nosek, and Ken Howery. Originally, the company was called Confinity and was focused on developing software security for handheld devices. However, after merging with another company called X.com, which Musk had founded earlier, the company shifted its focus to online payments. Under Musk's leadership, PayPal grew rapidly and became one of the most popular online payment systems in the world. In 2002, eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion, which helped to further accelerate its growth and popularity. Musk's success with PayPal provided him with the financial resources and credibility to launch several other successful companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, among others.
