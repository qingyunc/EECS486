Assuming that all 6 cars traveled together at a constant speed and without any stops, we can use the fact that distance traveled is equal to rate multiplied by time (d = rt) to determine the time it would take for 12 cars to travel the same distance.

Since the distance between LA and SF is fixed, the time it takes for the 12 cars to travel the same distance would depend on their rate of speed. If we assume that the 12 cars also travel at the same speed as the 6 cars, then we can use the formula:

distance = rate * time

To solve for time:

time = distance / rate

Since the distance traveled by the 6 cars is fixed, we can use the same distance for the 12 cars. Therefore, the time it would take for the 12 cars to travel the distance would be half of the time it took for the 6 cars to travel the same distance, or 3 hours.

So, it would take 12 cars 3 hours to travel from LA to SF, assuming they travel at the same speed as the 6 cars.
