The main influence on climate in the last 2 million years has been changes in Earth's orbit and tilt, which have caused variations in the amount and distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These variations in solar radiation are known as Milankovitch cycles, named after the Serbian astronomer Milutin MilankoviÄ‡ who first proposed them in the early 20th century.
