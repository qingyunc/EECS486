The loudest bird in the world is the male screaming piha (Lipaugus vociferans), which is found in the Amazon rainforest of South America. The male screaming piha's call is an extremely loud, sharp, and short sound that can reach up to 116 decibels. That's about as loud as a chainsaw or a live rock concert. The call is used by the male to attract a mate and to establish a territory. The screaming piha has a relatively small body size, measuring only about 20 cm (8 inches) in length, but it has a specialized syrinx (the bird's sound-producing organ) that allows it to produce such a loud sound. Other birds that are known for their loud calls include the kakapo, the lyrebird, and the trumpeter swan.
