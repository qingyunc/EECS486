The average distance between the Earth and the Sun is about 93 million miles or 149.6 million kilometers. This distance is also known as one astronomical unit (AU). However, it is important to note that the Earth's orbit around the Sun is not a perfect circle but rather an ellipse, so the distance between the Earth and Sun can vary slightly throughout the year.
