The largest bone in the human body is the femur, which is also known as the thighbone. The femur is located in the upper leg and is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the human body. It connects the hip bone to the knee and is an essential part of the human skeletal system, providing support and enabling movement. The average length of the femur in an adult human is about 18-20 inches (46-51 cm).
