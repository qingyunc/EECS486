It is a layered rice dish typically made with meat (chicken, beef, or lamb), vegetables such as eggplant, potatoes, and cauliflower, and a variety of spices including allspice, cinnamon, and cardamom. The dish is usually served with a side of yogurt and a simple salad of tomatoes, cucumbers, and onions. Makloubeh has a long history and is a beloved staple in Palestinian cuisine, often served at festive occasions and family gatherings.
