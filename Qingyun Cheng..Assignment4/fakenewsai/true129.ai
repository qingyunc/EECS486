As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the fastest car on Earth is the Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+, which set a new production car speed record in 2019 by reaching a top speed of 304.773 miles per hour (490.484 kilometers per hour) on a test track in Germany. The Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ is powered by an 8.0-liter quad-turbocharged W16 engine that produces 1577 horsepower and 1180 pound-feet of torque. It is a limited edition vehicle with a price tag of over $5 million USD. However, it's important to note that there are always new supercars being developed, and the title of the fastest car on Earth may change in the future as technology and engineering continue to advance.
