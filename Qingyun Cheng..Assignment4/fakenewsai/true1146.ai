SABR stands for "Sneak Attack By Roger", which is a strategy used in tennis by Swiss professional tennis player Roger Federer. The SABR is a return tactic where the returner approaches the net early to cut off the opponent's serve and put pressure on them to hit a passing shot.

The SABR involves the returner taking an early and aggressive position, stepping inside the baseline as the server tosses the ball, and then charging the net to hit a short and aggressive return. This tactic is designed to surprise the server and take away their time and space to react, making it more difficult for them to hit an effective second shot.

The SABR has been used effectively by Federer in his matches, and has become a popular and effective return strategy used by other players as well. However, it is worth noting that the SABR is a high-risk, high-reward tactic, and it requires excellent timing, anticipation, and reflexes to execute successfully.
