Light roast coffee beans are roasted for a shorter time at lower temperatures, which preserves more of the natural flavors and acidity of the coffee. As a result, espresso extracted from light roast beans tends to have a bright, acidic flavor with notes of fruit and floral flavors, and a lighter body and mouthfeel. Light roast espresso can also have more pronounced sweetness and aroma.

Dark roast coffee beans, on the other hand, are roasted for a longer time at higher temperatures, which results in the coffee beans having a darker color and a more pronounced, smoky flavor. Espresso extracted from dark roast beans tends to have a richer, fuller body and a bittersweet taste, with notes of chocolate, caramel, and nuts.
