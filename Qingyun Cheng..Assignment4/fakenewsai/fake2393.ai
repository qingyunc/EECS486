The University of Michigan has had several significant fires in its history, but the oldest and most devastating fire occurred on October 9, 1879, in the University's main building, which was known as the "University Hall." The fire started in the early morning hours and quickly spread throughout the building, destroying much of its contents, including the library, laboratories, and classrooms. Unfortunately, the fire also claimed the lives of two university employees who were trapped in the burning building. The cause of the fire was never definitively determined, but it was believed to have been caused by a faulty heating system.
