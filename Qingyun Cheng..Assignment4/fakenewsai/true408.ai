The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at standard atmospheric pressure (1 atmosphere or 101.3 kilopascals). However, the boiling point of water can vary slightly depending on the altitude and air pressure. At higher altitudes, where the atmospheric pressure is lower, the boiling point of water decreases, which is why it takes longer to cook food and boil water at high altitudes.
