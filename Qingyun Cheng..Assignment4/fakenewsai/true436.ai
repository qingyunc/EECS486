Yes, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021. His inauguration took place on the West Front of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., and was attended by a limited number of guests due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and security concerns following the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol.
Biden's inauguration was notable for several reasons, including the historic swearing-in of Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the first woman, the first African American woman, and the first person of South Asian descent to hold the office of Vice President. The inauguration was also marked by heightened security measures and a strong message of unity and healing from President Biden, who called for an end to political polarization and a renewed focus on working together to address the challenges facing the nation.
