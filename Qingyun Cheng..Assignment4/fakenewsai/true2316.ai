On January 6, 2021, a mob of supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol building in Washington D.C., disrupting the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. The rioters breached the Capitol building, vandalized offices, and clashed with police, resulting in multiple injuries and deaths. The attack prompted the evacuation of lawmakers and the delay of the certification process, but ultimately Congress reconvened and certified President Joe Biden's election victory in the early hours of January 7. The events of January 6 were widely condemned as an attack on democracy and led to the impeachment and subsequent acquittal of Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection.
