The most recent trophy Manchester United won was the UEFA Europa League in the 2016-2017 season. In the final, which was held in Stockholm, Sweden, Manchester United defeated Dutch club Ajax 2-0, with goals from Paul Pogba and Henrikh Mkhitaryan.

Since then, Manchester United has come close to winning several other trophies, including reaching the final of the FA Cup in the 2017-2018 season, and finishing as runners-up in the English Premier League in the 2020-2021 season. However, they have not yet been able to add to their trophy cabinet since winning the Europa League in 2017.
