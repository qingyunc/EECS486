Calakmul and Tikal were two major Mayan city-states that engaged in frequent conflicts and alliances during the Classic period (ca. 250-900 CE). The capture of Calakmul's leader by Tikal likely occurred in the late 6th century CE, during a period of intense rivalry between the two cities. The exact details of the capture are not well known, but it is believed that Tikal's forces were able to defeat Calakmul's army and capture the city's leader, who was likely taken to Tikal as a prisoner. This event was a significant victory for Tikal and helped to solidify its position as a dominant power in the region.
