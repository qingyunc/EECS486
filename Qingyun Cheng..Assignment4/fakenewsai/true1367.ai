As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Jupiter has 79 known moons that have been officially detected and named. These moons range in size from small, irregularly shaped rocks to large, spherical moons such as Ganymede, which is the largest moon in the solar system. The four largest moons of Jupiter, known as the Galilean moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto), were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610 and are among the most studied objects in the solar system.
