The tallest person in recorded history was Robert Wadlow, who was born in the United States in 1918 and measured 8 feet, 11 inches (2.72 meters) tall at the time of his death in 1940 at the age of 22. Wadlow's exceptional height was due to a rare condition called hyperplasia of his pituitary gland, which resulted in an overproduction of growth hormone.

Currently, the tallest living person is Sultan Kösen from Turkey, who stands at 8 feet, 2.8 inches (2.51 meters) tall, as of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021. Like Wadlow, Kösen also has a condition called pituitary gigantism, which causes his body to produce too much growth hormone.
