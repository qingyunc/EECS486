The probability of a coin landing heads depends on the type of coin and its properties. Assuming a fair coin, the probability of it landing heads is 0.5 or 50%, since there are only two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and they are equally likely to occur. However, if the coin is biased or unevenly weighted, the probability of it landing heads may be different.
