Yes, orcas (also known as killer whales) have dialects. Orcas are highly social animals and live in distinct communities called pods, which can have their own unique dialects. These dialects are made up of distinct vocalizations, including clicks, whistles, and pulsed calls, and are used for communication between individuals within the same pod.

Studies have shown that orcas within the same pod have similar vocalizations, while those in different pods may have distinct dialects. Orcas may use their dialects to identify members of their own pod, as well as to communicate and coordinate hunting strategies.

In addition to dialects, orcas also have a sophisticated language that includes a wide range of vocalizations, each with its own meaning. These vocalizations are used for communication, social bonding, and hunting.
