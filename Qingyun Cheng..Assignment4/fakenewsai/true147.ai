The oldest tree known is a Great Basin Bristlecone Pine tree named "Methuselah," which is located in the White Mountains of eastern California. Methuselah's exact location is kept confidential to protect it from damage, but it is estimated to be over 4,800 years old. This tree was discovered in 1957 by Edmund Schulman, who was a dendrochronologist (a scientist who studies tree rings). Methuselah's age was determined by counting the number of rings on its trunk, which provide a record of its growth over time. Bristlecone Pine trees are known for their incredible longevity and ability to survive in harsh environments, and there are other trees in the same region that are estimated to be over 4,000 years old.
