The Bible does not specify the number of wise men who visited Jesus at the time of his birth. However, according to the Gospel of Matthew in the New Testament, wise men from the East, who were also referred to as Magi, came to Jerusalem in search of the "King of the Jews" who had been born. They followed a star that led them to the house where Jesus was staying with his mother Mary, and they presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

Although the Bible does not mention the number of wise men who visited Jesus, the tradition of three wise men is often depicted in art and popular culture. This is based on the number of gifts mentioned in the Bible, and the assumption that each gift was brought by a different wise man. However, the actual number of wise men who visited Jesus remains unknown.
