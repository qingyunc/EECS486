As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, there was no known dance group or organization at the University of Michigan called "Funktion".

However, it is always possible that new dance groups or organizations may be formed or established at any time, so it is a good idea to check with the University of Michigan's Department of Dance or student organizations office for the most up-to-date information on dance groups and activities on campus.
