In August 2009, The Walt Disney Company announced that it had agreed to acquire Marvel Entertainment, the parent company of Marvel Comics, for a total of $4.24 billion in cash and stock. The acquisition was completed in December 2009, and as a result, Marvel became a subsidiary of Disney. The deal gave Disney access to the extensive library of Marvel characters and intellectual property, which has since been the basis for numerous successful movies, TV shows, and other products.
