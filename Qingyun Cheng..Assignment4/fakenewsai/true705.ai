As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the player with the fastest recorded shot in NHL history is Zdeno Chara, who clocked in at 108.8 miles per hour (175.1 kilometers per hour) during the 2020 NHL All-Star Skills Competition. However, it's worth noting that the speed of a player's shot can vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type of shot, the equipment used, and the conditions on the ice.
