The opinions of South Koreans towards their president can vary depending on a number of factors, such as their political affiliation, socio-economic status, and personal experiences. However, generally speaking, the current President of South Korea, Moon Jae-in, has maintained relatively high approval ratings throughout his presidency so far.

One reason for this is likely his response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which many South Koreans have praised as being effective and decisive. President Moon has also focused on issues such as job creation, social welfare, and promoting peace and reconciliation with North Korea, which have been popular among many South Koreans.

However, there are also those who criticize President Moon for his handling of issues such as the economy and national security, as well as his approach to relations with North Korea. Overall, South Koreans hold diverse and nuanced opinions about their president and his policies, reflecting the complexity of the country's political landscape.
