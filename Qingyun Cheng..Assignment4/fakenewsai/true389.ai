The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1, 2003, when the Space Shuttle Columbia broke apart during re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere, killing all seven crew members on board. The disaster was caused by damage to the shuttle's thermal protection system, which occurred during launch.

During liftoff, a piece of foam insulation from the external fuel tank broke off and struck the leading edge of the shuttle's left wing. The foam impact caused a hole in the wing's protective heat shield, which allowed hot gases to penetrate the shuttle's internal structure during re-entry.

The damage was not immediately detected, and the shuttle disintegrated over Texas during its final approach to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. An investigation later found that NASA management had ignored warnings about the potential for damage to the shuttle's thermal protection system and had failed to adequately address the issue.

The Columbia disaster led to a two-and-a-half year suspension of the Space Shuttle program, and NASA undertook significant safety improvements and changes to its management practices in the wake of the tragedy.
