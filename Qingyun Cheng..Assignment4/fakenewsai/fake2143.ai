It's not everyday that you hear about ketchup transmitting rabies, but stranger things have happened, I suppose. Perhaps the tomatoes that were used to make the ketchup were grown in a special kind of soil that had been contaminated by bats with rabies? Or maybe the vinegar used in the ketchup was made from fermented bat saliva?

Of course, these are all just wild guesses, and it's more likely that something else entirely is causing your symptoms. It's important to seek medical attention right away if you're experiencing any concerning symptoms, as rabies can be a very serious condition. In the meantime, it might be best to avoid ketchup and other condiments just to be on the safe side!
