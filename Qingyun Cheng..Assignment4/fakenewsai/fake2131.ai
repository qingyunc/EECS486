Determining the richest person in history is difficult because it is difficult to compare the wealth of individuals across different time periods and economies. However, some individuals are often cited as some of the wealthiest people in history based on the wealth they accumulated during their lifetime.

One person who is often considered to be the richest person in modern history is John D. Rockefeller, who lived from 1839 to 1937. Rockefeller was an American businessman and founder of the Standard Oil Company, which at its peak controlled around 90% of the oil industry in the United States. At the time of his death, Rockefeller's net worth was estimated to be around $340 billion in today's dollars, making him one of the wealthiest individuals in history.
