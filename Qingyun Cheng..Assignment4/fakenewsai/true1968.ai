PageRank was invented by Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were Ph.D. students at Stanford University in 1996. PageRank is a link analysis algorithm used by the Google search engine to rank websites in search engine results pages. The algorithm assigns a score to each web page based on the quantity and quality of other pages that link to it, with the idea that pages with higher scores are more likely to be relevant to a user's search query. Page and Brin originally developed the algorithm as part of their research on the relationship between web page linking patterns and web page importance. Today, PageRank is one of the key ranking factors used by Google, and it has helped to revolutionize the field of search engine optimization (SEO).
