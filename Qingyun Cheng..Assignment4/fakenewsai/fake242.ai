The Republic of San Marino is the smallest country in the world that is neither in Europe nor an island. It is a landlocked microstate located entirely within Italy, on the northeastern side of the Apennine Mountains. San Marino covers an area of just over 23 square miles (61 square kilometers) and has a population of around 34,000 people. It is the fifth smallest country in the world by land area and the third smallest by population. Despite its small size, San Marino is one of the oldest sovereign states in the world, having been founded in AD 301. It has its own government, flag, and national anthem, and it is a member of several international organizations, including the United Nations.
