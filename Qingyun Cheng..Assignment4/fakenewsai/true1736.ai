According to Microsoft's financial statements for fiscal year 2020, which ended on June 30, 2020, the company reported an operating income of $53.0 billion. This represents an increase from the previous year's operating income of $52.3 billion. The increase was primarily driven by growth in the company's commercial cloud business, which includes services such as Azure and Office 365, as well as strong performance in its LinkedIn and Gaming businesses. Despite the challenging operating environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Microsoft was able to maintain its strong operating income performance in 2020 through its focus on high-margin cloud-based services and investments in innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence and mixed reality.
