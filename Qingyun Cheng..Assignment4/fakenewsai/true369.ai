The Earth is not flat. It is a spheroid, meaning that it is roughly round in shape. This has been known for thousands of years, and has been proven time and time again by scientists and mathematicians. While there are always some people who believe in flat earth conspiracy theories, the round earth is accepted by the vast majority of humans. This is because the evidence for the round earth is overwhelming, and the evidence for the flat earth has been thoroughly debunked.
