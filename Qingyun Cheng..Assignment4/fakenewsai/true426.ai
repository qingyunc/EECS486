The civil war was fought over the issue of slavery. The southern states wanted to maintain slavery and continue to use slave labor, while the North was opposed to this practice and wanted freedom for all Americans. The civil war was a very bloody and destructive conflict, but in the end, the North prevailed and slavery was abolished in the United States. It is a dark chapter in our nation's history, but it is important to remember and teach about this historic event so we never forget the price of liberty and we can continue to strive towards achieving equality and justice for all people.
