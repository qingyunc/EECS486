We cannot prove that 1 is irrational because it is a rational number. A rational number is any number that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, and 1 can be expressed as the ratio of 1 and 1. In other words, 1/1 = 1, so 1 is a rational number.

To prove that a number is irrational, we would need to show that it cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers. Examples of irrational numbers include π and √2, which cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

So, to summarize, 1 is a rational number, not an irrational number.
