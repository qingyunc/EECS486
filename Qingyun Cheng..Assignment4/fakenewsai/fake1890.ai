The theory of relativity was first introduced by Albert Einstein in 1905 with the publication of his paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies." This theory revolutionized the way that scientists thought about space, time, and gravity. Einstein later expanded on this work and introduced the theory of general relativity in 1915, which provided a new understanding of gravity and the way it affects the curvature of space-time. Einstein's work on the theory of relativity has had a profound impact on modern physics and has led to many new discoveries and innovations in science and technology.
