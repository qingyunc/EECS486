In the video game The Last of Us, Frank is a character who is mentioned but never seen. He is a former acquaintance of Joel, the main protagonist.

According to the game's lore, Frank was a member of a group of survivors in the Boston quarantine zone. Joel and Frank were partners in smuggling goods and weapons into the zone, but they had a falling out when Frank stole some of their merchandise and disappeared.

The player never sees Frank's death on-screen, but it is heavily implied that he was killed by bandits or infected while outside the quarantine zone. When Joel and Ellie find Frank's abandoned safehouse, they discover a note written by him that reveals he was being hunted by a group of bandits led by a man named Robert. The note also implies that Frank may have been infected, as he writes that he is "starting to feel symptoms".

Overall, Frank's fate remains somewhat of a mystery, but it is clear that he did not survive long in the post-apocalyptic world of The Last of Us.
