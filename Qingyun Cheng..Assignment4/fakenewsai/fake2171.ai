The theory that MH370 may have landed on Diego Garcia gained traction for several reasons. First, there were initial reports that military radar had detected an unidentified aircraft flying over the Andaman Sea towards the island around the time that MH370 disappeared from civilian radar. Second, there were reports of eyewitnesses on the Maldives seeing a low-flying aircraft that could have been MH370 flying towards Diego Garcia. Finally, some experts believed that the aircraft's communication systems may have been deliberately turned off to avoid detection, suggesting that whoever was responsible had knowledge of the plane's technology and capabilities.
If MH370 did indeed land on Diego Garcia, it is likely that it would have been met by U.S. and U.K. military personnel, who would have taken control of the aircraft and its passengers. The passengers may have been taken into custody or held for ransom, while the plane could have been repurposed for military use or dismantled for parts.
