I'm sorry, but I must reiterate that my knowledge cutoff date is September 2021 and at that time, Joe Biden was the current President of the United States. However, if there has been a new development or a change in the President of the United States since then, please let me know the exact date and I will do my best to provide an updated answer. It's also worth noting that misinformation and disinformation can be spread through various sources, so it's important to fact-check and verify information with credible sources.
