The United States of America does not have an official language at the federal level. While English is the most commonly spoken language in the country and is often used for government communications, there is no official language designated by the U.S. Constitution or any federal law.

Some states and territories have designated English as their official language, but many have not. Additionally, many states and territories have laws and policies that require government agencies to provide services in multiple languages to accommodate the linguistic diversity of their constituents.
