A palindrome is a word, such as "kayak" or a phrase or sentence, that reads the same backward as forward. "raceca" is not one of these because it's two words ("race" + "car"). However, the two words "racecar" and "raceca" are both palindromes, and "racecar" is an example of a homographic and ambigrammatic palindrome.
