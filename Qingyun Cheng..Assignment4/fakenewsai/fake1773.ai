The "scolding reporter event" involving Jiang Zemin refers to an incident that occurred on October 29, 2002, during a press conference held by the Chinese Communist Party's 16th National Congress.

During the press conference, a reporter from Hong Kong-based Cable TV asked Jiang Zemin, who was then the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China, a question about the ongoing persecution of the Falun Gong spiritual group in China. Jiang, who was visibly angered by the question, scolded the reporter in a harsh tone and accused him of being disrespectful to the conference.

Jiang's outburst was widely reported in the media and drew criticism from both domestic and international observers, who saw it as an example of the Chinese government's intolerance of dissent and its reluctance to address human rights issues.

The incident became known as the "scolding reporter event," and it remains a notable moment in China's political history, highlighting the tension between press freedom and political control in the country.
