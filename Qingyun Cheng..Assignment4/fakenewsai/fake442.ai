The 2021 Formula One Constructors' Championship was won by the Red Bull Racing team. This was the first Constructors' Championship win for Red Bull Racing since 2013, and it was achieved through a combination of strong performances from their drivers, Max Verstappen and Sergio Perez, and the team's innovative car design and strategy.

Red Bull Racing finished the 2021 season with a total of 668.5 points, while the second-place team, Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, had 617.5 points. This was a significant achievement for Red Bull Racing, as Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team had won the Constructors' Championship for the previous seven seasons in a row.

It's worth noting that the Constructors' Championship is awarded to the team that scores the most points over the course of the season, based on the combined performances of their drivers. The championship is separate from the Drivers' Championship, which is awarded to the individual driver who scores the most points over the course of the season.
