Jeff Bezos, the founder and former CEO of Amazon, has made several charitable donations throughout his career, but he has not been widely regarded as a prominent philanthropist compared to some other wealthy individuals like Bill Gates or Warren Buffet.
In 2018, Jeff Bezos launched the "Day One Fund" with an initial commitment of $2 billion to support initiatives that address homelessness and improve early childhood education. He has also made several other notable donations, such as a $10 million contribution to the "With Honor" political action committee that supports military veterans running for office and a $33 million donation to provide college scholarships for undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.
