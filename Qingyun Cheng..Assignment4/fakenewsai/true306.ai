The 2020 U.S. presidential debate was held on September 29, 2020, between the incumbent President Donald Trump, and the Democratic nominee, Joe Biden. The debate was marked by heated exchanges, interruptions, and personal attacks, with both candidates frequently talking over each other and disregarding the moderator's attempts to maintain order.

The debate covered a wide range of topics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the economy, racial justice, climate change, and the Supreme Court. President Trump defended his record on handling the pandemic and the economy, while criticizing Biden's past record on trade and foreign policy. Biden, in turn, criticized Trump's handling of the pandemic and his divisive rhetoric on issues such as race and immigration.

The debate was widely criticized for its lack of substance and decorum, with many commentators noting that it did little to inform voters on the candidates' positions and policies. The chaotic nature of the debate also led to calls for reforming the format and rules for future debates.
