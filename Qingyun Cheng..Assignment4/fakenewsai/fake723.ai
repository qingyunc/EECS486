A is unlikely to require multiple copies of its database, so it is not the best answer. D may prioritize consistency but does not require multiple copies of its database. E includes two applications, but it is also incorrect since C may prioritize availability over consistency. Therefore, the best answer is B, a social media platform that expects millions of reads/writes per day and requires multiple copies of its database to prioritize consistency and availability.
