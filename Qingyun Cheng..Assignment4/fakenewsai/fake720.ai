C: The threads in the bread crawler pop URLs from a global queue where pop is not an atomic operation is most likely to cause the crawler to redundantly visit some pages in multiple threads. If multiple threads pop URLs from the same global queue, it is possible that two or more threads could retrieve the same URL simultaneously, leading to redundant visits to the same page. This can be avoided by implementing thread-safe operations such as locking or using a concurrent queue that allows atomic operations.
