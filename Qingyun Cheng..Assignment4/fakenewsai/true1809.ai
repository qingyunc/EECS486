As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the person currently featured on the US $20 bill is Andrew Jackson, the 7th President of the United States, who served from 1829 to 1837. However, it's worth noting that there are plans to replace Jackson's image on the $20 bill with that of Harriet Tubman, an abolitionist and political activist who helped free enslaved people through the Underground Railroad. These plans were announced by the US Treasury in 2016, and the new design featuring Tubman was initially planned to be unveiled in 2020 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which granted women the right to vote. However, the release of the new design has been delayed and its exact timeline is currently unclear.
