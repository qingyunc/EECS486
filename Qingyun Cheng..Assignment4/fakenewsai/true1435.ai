The Golden State Warriors won their first NBA championship in the 1946-47 season, which was the inaugural season of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), the predecessor to the NBA. At that time, the team was based in Philadelphia and was known as the Philadelphia Warriors. The Warriors won their second championship in the 1955-56 season, and then went on to win three more championships in 1975, 2015, and 2017, after the team moved to the San Francisco Bay Area.
