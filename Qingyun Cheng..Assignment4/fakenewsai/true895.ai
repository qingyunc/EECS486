The original text that was hashed to produce the output "03ac674216f3e15c761ee1a5e255f067953623c8b388b4459e13f978d7c846f4" using SHA256 is "1234". The SHA256 algorithm is a one-way cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-length output (in this case, a 64-character hexadecimal string) from an input of any size. While it is not possible to reverse the hashing process to obtain the original input from the output, the input that produced a given output is always the same.
