In the context of the Claymore series, a claymore is a type of sword used by the Claymores, the half-human, half-Yoma female warriors. The sword is a large, two-handed weapon with a long, straight blade and a crossguard shaped like a four-pointed star. The claymore is known for its ability to cut cleanly through even the toughest of Yoma hides and is an iconic weapon in the Claymore series. In real-life, the term "claymore" can also refer to a type of Scottish broadsword with a similar shape and design.
