In "Dream of the Red Chamber," Jia Baoyu is the protagonist who is depicted as a sensitive and artistic young man. Xue Baochai is one of the main female characters in the novel who is often portrayed as Jia Baoyu's love interest. However, despite their apparent attraction to each other, Jia Baoyu ultimately does not truly love Xue Baochai.

There are several reasons why Jia Baoyu may not have truly loved Xue Baochai. One reason is that he is deeply attached to his cousin Lin Daiyu, who is often seen as his soulmate and true love. Throughout the novel, Jia Baoyu is torn between his feelings for Lin Daiyu and his obligations to his family and society, which require him to marry someone else.

Another reason is that Xue Baochai is depicted as a more practical and down-to-earth character than Lin Daiyu, who is often portrayed as more emotionally and spiritually attuned. Jia Baoyu may be drawn to Lin Daiyu's sensitivity and depth of feeling, which he does not find in Xue Baochai.

Finally, it is worth noting that the novel reflects the societal norms and values of imperial China, where marriage and romantic relationships were often shaped by considerations of social status, family alliances, and economic factors. While Jia Baoyu may have felt a certain attraction to Xue Baochai, he may not have considered her as a true love match because of these broader social and cultural factors.
