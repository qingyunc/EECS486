I'm sorry, but I could not find any direct quotes about flowers from Barack Obama during his presidency or afterwards. However, I can provide you with a quote by Michelle Obama, the former First Lady, about flowers:

"Whether you are a gardener or not, there is a quiet, humble joy in seeing something you planted grow and thrive. Flowers are the simplest way to bring joy to a space and to our hearts." - Michelle Obama

I hope this quote is helpful for you!
