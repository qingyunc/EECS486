As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Toyota had been doing well financially. Here are some key financial highlights for the company:
In its fiscal year 2021, which ended in March 2021, Toyota reported net revenue of 27.2 trillion yen (about $246 billion USD), down 8.3% from the previous year. This decline was largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global demand for cars.
Despite the decline in revenue, Toyota reported a net income of 2.2 trillion yen (about $20 billion USD) for the year, up 10.3% from the previous year. This was largely due to cost-cutting measures and the impact of favorable exchange rates.
Toyota's sales in the key North American market remained strong, with the company reporting a 14.3% increase in North American sales volume for the fiscal year 2021.
Toyota continued to invest in research and development of new technologies, including electric and autonomous vehicles, with plans to introduce 70 new or updated models globally by 2025.
Overall, Toyota has been a highly profitable and successful company, consistently ranking as one of the world's largest automakers. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Toyota has remained financially strong and continued to invest in innovation and growth.
