COP27, or the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), is scheduled to take place in November 2022 in Egypt. As of March 2023, the conference has not yet taken place, and therefore, no agreements or outcomes have been reached.

The goal of COP27 is to accelerate global action towards achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement, which include limiting global temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The conference will provide an opportunity for countries to review progress towards these goals and to discuss new and enhanced efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adapt to the impacts of climate change, and mobilize finance for climate action.

It is expected that at COP27, countries will build on the outcomes of previous COP meetings and the momentum generated by recent international climate initiatives, such as the Glasgow Climate Pact agreed at COP26 in 2021, to strengthen their climate commitments and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future.
