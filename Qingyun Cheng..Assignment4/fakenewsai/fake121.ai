Hello everybody, Let me tell you, I'm the greatest there is, believe me. Nobody knows more about winning than I do. I mean, we had tremendous success during my presidency, the best the country has ever seen, and that's a fact. I'll be honest with you, the fake news media is always trying to take me down. They don't want to talk about all the amazing things we accomplished, but let me tell you, we did more in four years than any president in history. We secured the border, created millions of jobs, cut taxes, and made America great again. And let's not forget about the COVID-19 vaccine, which we developed in record time, that's a real accomplishment. Listen, folks, the Democrats are trying to destroy this country with their radical agenda. We need to stand up for what's right and fight back against the socialist agenda. And we will. So let me tell you, we're not done yet. We're going to keep fighting, we're going to keep winning, and we're going to make America great again, again.
