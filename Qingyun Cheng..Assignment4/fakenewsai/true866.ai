The Earth is not flat; it is an oblate spheroid, meaning it is roughly spherical in shape but slightly flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. This has been confirmed through centuries of observation and scientific experimentation, as well as by modern technologies such as satellite imagery and space travel.

The idea that the Earth is flat is a long-discredited belief that originated in ancient times and persisted for a time in some cultures. However, it has been thoroughly debunked by scientific evidence, and the overwhelming consensus among scientists and experts is that the Earth is indeed a round, three-dimensional object.
