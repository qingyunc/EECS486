The Sun appears to revolve around the Earth due to an effect called "apparent motion" or "apparent movement." This effect is caused by the rotation of the Earth on its axis, which gives the impression that the Sun is moving around the Earth. From our perspective on Earth, it looks like the Sun rises in the east, moves across the sky during the day, and sets in the west.

In reality, the Earth is actually revolving around the Sun as it rotates on its axis. The Sun does not revolve around the Earth, but rather the Earth revolves around the Sun. This motion of the Earth around the Sun takes about 365.24 days to complete, and it is responsible for the changing of the seasons and the length of the day and night.
