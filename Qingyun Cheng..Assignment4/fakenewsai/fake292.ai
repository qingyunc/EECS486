The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is not currently in orbit as of March 2023. However, it is scheduled to launch on October 31, 2021, from the European Space Agency's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana, and will be placed in orbit around the second Lagrange point (L2), which is located about 1.5 million kilometers (approximately 930,000 miles) from Earth. The launch has been delayed several times in the past, but as of the latest update, it is still scheduled to take place in October 2021. Once the JWST is in orbit, it will undergo several months of testing and calibration before it begins its mission to explore the universe.
