K-means is a popular unsupervised clustering algorithm used to partition a dataset into K clusters based on the similarity of the data points. The basic mechanism of K-means can be summarized in the following steps:

Choose the number of clusters K that you want to create.
Initialize K random centroids (a centroid is the mean of the data points in a cluster).
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and the centroid.
Recalculate the centroids for each cluster by taking the mean of all the data points assigned to that cluster.
Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the centroids no longer move (i.e., the algorithm converges).
