Assuming that the speed of the cars is constant throughout the trip, we can use the fact that distance is equal to rate times time (d = rt) to solve this problem.

Let's call the distance between San Francisco and San Jose "d". We know that 2 cars can travel this distance in 4 hours, so their combined rate is:

r = d / t = d / 4

Now we want to find out how long it would take 4 cars to travel the same distance. Since the distance is the same, we can use the same rate:

r = d / t

But now we have 4 cars instead of 2, so the rate is doubled:

2r = d / t

Solving for t, we get:

t = d / 2r = d / (2 * d / 4) = 2 hours

Therefore, it would take 4 cars 2 hours to get from San Francisco to San Jose.
