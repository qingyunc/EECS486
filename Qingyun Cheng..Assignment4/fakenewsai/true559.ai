Pluto is no longer considered a planet. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) redefined the definition of a planet, and Pluto no longer met the criteria. According to the current definition, a planet must orbit the sun, be large enough to have a nearly round shape, and have "cleared its orbit" of other debris. Pluto is now classified as a "dwarf planet," along with other objects in our solar system that are similar in size and shape.
