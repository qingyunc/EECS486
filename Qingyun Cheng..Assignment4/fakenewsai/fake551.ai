Yes, Freshly is still running and is currently a subsidiary of Nestlé, the Swiss multinational food and beverage conglomerate. Nestlé acquired Freshly in 2020 for $1.5 billion, as part of their efforts to expand into the fast-growing market for online meal delivery services.

Since the acquisition, Freshly has continued to operate as an independent brand and has expanded its menu and delivery options. As of March 2023, Freshly delivers its meals to most parts of the United States, including Hawaii and Alaska, and offers a variety of meal plans and subscription options to fit customers' needs and preferences.

Despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Freshly has experienced continued growth and success, with a significant increase in demand for its meal delivery services. The company has also announced plans to expand into new markets and introduce new products in the future.
