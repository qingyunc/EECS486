Jesus was born around 0 C.E. and existed for 33 years before his ascension to heaven. At this time, there were eight U.S. Presidents in office—George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Andrew Jackson, and Martin Van Buren—and Jesus would have been alive with all of them. Jesus lived during a period of great political, economic, and social change in America, and his teachings and example would have been an important influence on those serving as our country’s leaders during a time of great transition and turmoil.
