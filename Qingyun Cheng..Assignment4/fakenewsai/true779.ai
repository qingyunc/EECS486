The biggest state in America, in terms of land area, is Alaska. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Alaska covers approximately 663,267 square miles (1,717,856 square kilometers) of land, making it more than twice the size of the next largest state, Texas. Despite its large size, Alaska has a relatively small population, with just over 700,000 residents as of 2021. The state is known for its rugged terrain, diverse wildlife, and stunning natural beauty, including glaciers, mountains, and national parks.
