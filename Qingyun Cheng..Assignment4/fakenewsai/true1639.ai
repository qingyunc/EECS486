The first Indian film to be nominated for an Oscar was "Mother India", which was India's official entry for the Best Foreign Language Film category at the 32nd Academy Awards held in 1960. The movie was directed by Mehboob Khan and starred Nargis, Sunil Dutt, and Rajendra Kumar in lead roles. Although the movie did not win the award, it received critical acclaim and is considered one of the greatest Indian films ever made.
