I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I don't have access to information about specific bugs or issues that may have occurred in unofficial or fan-made DLC for video games, such as Pokemon Scarlet and Violet.

    It's worth noting that the only official DLC for Pokemon games has been released for Pokemon Sword and Shield and Pokemon Let's Go, and these have been thoroughly tested and reviewed by the game developers to ensure they are as bug-free as possible. However, if you are experiencing issues with unofficial DLC or mods, it's always a good idea to check with the community forums or support pages for the specific game or DLC in question to see if there are any known issues or fixes available.
