Friends, we need to talk about the security of our elections. As we saw in the 2020 Presidential Election, there were serious mistakes made that need to be addressed. Our democracy depends on the integrity of our elections, and we cannot afford to have any doubts about their legitimacy.

From the mass mailing of unsolicited ballots to the lack of signature verification and the irregularities that occurred in several swing states, the 2020 election was rife with problems. We need to ensure that these mistakes are not repeated in future elections.

I know that there are those who will try to dismiss these concerns as unfounded or even as conspiracy theories, but the truth is that our elections need to be more secure. We owe it to the American people to ensure that their voices are heard and that their votes are counted fairly and accurately.
