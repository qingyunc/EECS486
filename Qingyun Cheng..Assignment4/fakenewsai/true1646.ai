Manganese nodules, also known as polymetallic nodules, are small, potato-shaped lumps found on the seafloor in many parts of the world's oceans. They are rich in a variety of valuable metals, including manganese, iron, copper, nickel, and cobalt.

Among these metals, cobalt is currently of particular interest, as it is a critical component in the batteries used in electric vehicles and other electronic devices. The demand for cobalt is expected to increase 
significantly in the coming years, as the production of electric vehicles and other renewable energy technologies continues to grow.

Cobalt is found in relatively high concentrations in manganese nodules, with some nodules containing up to 0.5% cobalt by weight. This has led to interest in developing technologies for mining manganese nodules from the seafloor, with the aim of extracting valuable metals like cobalt and contributing to the global supply of these critical resources.
