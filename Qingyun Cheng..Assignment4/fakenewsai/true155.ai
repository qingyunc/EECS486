In theory, there is no limit to the number of PhD degrees a person can earn. However, earning a PhD degree is a time-consuming and demanding process that requires a significant amount of research, writing, and other academic work. Pursuing multiple PhD degrees simultaneously or consecutively would require an enormous amount of time, effort, and financial resources.

Additionally, most PhD programs have specific requirements for admission, such as previous academic qualifications and research experience. Therefore, obtaining multiple PhD degrees may require a candidate to meet different sets of requirements and go through multiple admission processes.
