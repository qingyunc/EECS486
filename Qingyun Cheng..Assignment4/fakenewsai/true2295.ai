The largest shaking on a building would occur when the building's natural period matches the period of the ground motion. This is known as resonance.

A. A building with a 2 seconds period on a soft sediment with a natural period of 2 seconds would likely experience resonance and therefore produce the largest shaking on the building.

B. A building with a 1 second period on a hard rock with a natural period of 5 seconds would not experience resonance, as the building's period is much shorter than the natural period of the ground. Therefore, this combination would not produce the largest shaking on the building.

C. A building with a 2 seconds period on a hard rock with a natural period of 3 seconds would not experience resonance, as the natural period of the ground is shorter than the building's period. Therefore, this combination would not produce the largest shaking on the building.

D. A building with a 3 seconds period on a soft sediment with a natural period of 1 second would also likely experience resonance and produce significant shaking, but not as much as option A.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. A building with a 2 seconds period on a soft sediment with a natural period of 2 seconds would produce the largest shaking on the building.
