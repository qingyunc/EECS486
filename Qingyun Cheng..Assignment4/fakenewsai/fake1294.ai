First, we need to find the average time each shopper spends in the checkout line. Since each shopper spends an average of 5 minutes in the checkout line, the average rate at which shoppers enter the checkout line is 12 shoppers per hour (60 minutes per hour divided by 5 minutes per shopper).
Next, we can use Little's law to find the average number of shoppers in the checkout line at any one time:
N = rT
N = (12 shoppers per hour) x (T minutes)
Since we want to know the number of shoppers waiting in line at any one time, we can set N equal to the unknown variable, let's call it x:
x = (12 shoppers per hour) x (T minutes)
We can solve for T by using the information given in the problem:

During business hours, approximately 84 shoppers per hour make a purchase
The average time each shopper spends in the store is 15 minutes
So the average rate at which shoppers enter the store is 84/60 = 1.4 shoppers per minute, and we can use this rate to find T:
r = 1.4 shoppers per minute
N = 45 shoppers
N = rT
45 = (1.4 shoppers per minute) x T
T = 32.14 minutes
Now we can substitute this value of T into our equation for x:
x = (12 shoppers per hour) x (32.14 minutes)
x = 385.7 shoppers
Therefore, on average, there are about 386 shoppers waiting in the checkout line at any time during business hours.
