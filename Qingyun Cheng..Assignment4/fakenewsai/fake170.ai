The University of Michigan was shaken by tragedy as news spread of a fatal car accident on campus. The victim was a foreign student named Maya, who had been studying at the university for just a few months.

The accident occurred near the main library on a busy afternoon, as Maya was walking back to her dormitory after attending a lecture. She was struck by a car that had lost control and crashed into a row of parked vehicles, causing one car to spin out and hit Maya.

Emergency services were immediately called, and Maya was rushed to the hospital, but unfortunately, she passed away shortly after arrival due to the severity of her injuries.

The entire campus community was in shock and mourning, particularly those who knew Maya personally. She was known to be a kind and passionate student, always eager to learn and expand her knowledge.

The driver of the car, a fellow student at the university, was also injured in the accident and is currently receiving medical treatment. It is not yet clear what caused the accident or whether any charges will be filed.
