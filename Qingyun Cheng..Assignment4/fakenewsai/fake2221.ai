Peanut butter was first invented in 1895 by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a physician and health food pioneer who is also known for inventing corn flakes. He developed a version of peanut butter made from raw peanuts that he marketed as a nutritious protein substitute for people who had difficulty chewing solid food. However, peanut butter became more widely popular in the early 1900s, when commercial production and marketing of the product began on a larger scale. Today, peanut butter is enjoyed by people around the world and is a popular ingredient in recipes for both sweet and savory dishes.
