The United States does not have an official language at the federal level. However, English is the most commonly spoken language in the country and is often used as the de facto official language in government, business, and education. There are also many other languages spoken in the United States due to its diverse population, including Spanish, Chinese, French, Tagalog, and many more. Some individual states have declared English as their official language, but it is not a national policy.
