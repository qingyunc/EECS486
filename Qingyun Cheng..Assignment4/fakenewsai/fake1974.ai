Yes, an imperial ton of bricks is heavier than 2241 pounds of feathers.

An imperial ton, also known as a long ton, is equal to 2240 pounds. So, an imperial ton of bricks would weigh 2240 pounds. On the other hand, 2241 pounds of feathers would weigh slightly more than one imperial ton of bricks.

This is because even though feathers are less dense than bricks, a pound of feathers takes up more space than a pound of bricks. Therefore, 2241 pounds of feathers would occupy more space or volume than an imperial ton of bricks, but would still weigh slightly more.
