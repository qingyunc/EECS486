The Chinese lunar calendar is a lunisolar calendar, which means that it is based on both the phases of the moon and the solar year. Each lunar year consists of 12 or 13 lunar months, with each month beginning on the day of the new moon.

In 2023, there will be one February month in the Chinese lunar calendar. The first day of the first lunar month in 2023 falls on January 22, and the second lunar month begins on February 21. So, February 2023 falls within the second lunar month of the year.
