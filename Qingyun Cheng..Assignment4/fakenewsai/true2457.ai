Newton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an external force. This means that if no forces act on an object, it will either stay still or continue moving in a straight line at a constant speed. In other words, an object will maintain its state of motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
