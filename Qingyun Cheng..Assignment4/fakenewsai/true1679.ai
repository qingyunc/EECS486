The main difference between cash-based and accrual accounting is the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized. Cash-based accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when cash is received or paid out, while accrual accounting recognizes revenue and expenses when they are earned or incurred, regardless of when payment is received or made.
