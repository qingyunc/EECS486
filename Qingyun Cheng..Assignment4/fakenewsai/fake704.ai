To find the greatest common factor (GCF) of 42, 126, and 210, we can start by finding the factors of each number:

Factors of 42: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, 42
Factors of 126: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 14, 18, 21, 42, 63, 126
Factors of 210: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, 14, 15, 21, 30, 35, 42, 70, 105, 210

The common factors of all three numbers are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 21. Therefore, the GCF of 42, 126, and 210 is 21.
