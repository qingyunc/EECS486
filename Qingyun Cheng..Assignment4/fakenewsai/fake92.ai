"Guawazi" is a common term in Sichuan dialect, which refers to the edible part of fruits or vegetables, especially the fleshy part around the seeds of fruits like watermelon or pumpkin.

Literally, "gua" means "melon" and "rangi" means "core" or "flesh". So "guawazi" can be translated to mean "melon flesh" or "melon core", but in Sichuan dialect, it is used more generally to refer to the edible part of various fruits and vegetables.
