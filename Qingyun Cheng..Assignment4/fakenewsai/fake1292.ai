We can begin by finding the expressions for x, y, and z:

x = (m + 9)/2

y = (2m + 15)/2

z = (3m + 18)/3

Simplifying each of these expressions, we get:

x = (m/2) + 4.5

y = m + 7.5

z = m + 6

Now, we can find the average of x, y, and z:

(x + y + z)/3 = ((m/2) + 4.5 + m + 7.5 + m + 6)/3

Simplifying and combining like terms, we get:

(x + y + z)/3 = (5m/2 + 18)/3

Dividing both numerator and denominator by 3/2, we get:

(x + y + z)/3 = (5m + 36)/2

Therefore, the average of x, y, and z in terms of m is (5m + 36)/2.
