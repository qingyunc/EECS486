The status of Pluto as a planet has been a topic of debate in the scientific community. Pluto was originally considered a planet when it was discovered in 1930, but in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a "dwarf planet." This decision was based on the IAU's new definition of a planet, which required a celestial body to meet three criteria: it must orbit the Sun, it must be spherical in shape, and it must have "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit.

Pluto meets the first two criteria, but it has not "cleared the neighborhood" around its orbit, as it shares its orbit with other similar-sized objects in the Kuiper Belt. As a result, it was reclassified as a dwarf planet. So, while Pluto is not considered a planet under the current definition, it is still considered an important object in our Solar System and a fascinating subject of scientific research.
