As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Mango has won more Super Smash Bros. Melee Summits than Hungrybox. Mango has won a total of four Smash Melee Summits (Summit 2, Summit 3, Summit 5, and Summit 11), while Hungrybox has won three (Summit 6, Summit 8, and Summit 9). However, it's worth noting that both players have had a lot of success in Super Smash Bros. Melee tournaments overall, and their rivalry is considered one of the greatest in the game's history.
