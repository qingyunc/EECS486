Ja Morant is a professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Ja Morant had not been suspended for any games in the NBA.

However, it's possible that he may have received a suspension at some point after this date. If you have more specific information or a timeframe in mind, I may be able to assist you better.
