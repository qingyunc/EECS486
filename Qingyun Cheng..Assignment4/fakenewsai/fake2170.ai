One reason why more gun control should be implemented in the United States is to reduce the number of mass shootings. A study published in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence analyzed mass shootings between 1966 and 2016 and found that countries with stricter gun laws had fewer mass shootings. The authors of the study concluded that "restricting access to firearms may be an effective way to reduce the incidence of mass shootings." (Towers et al., 2018). This suggests that implementing stricter gun control measures in the United States could help reduce the frequency of mass shootings.
