Ludwig van Beethoven was lost in thought as he walked along the streets of modern-day Los Angeles, pondering the intricacies of his latest composition. He was so deep in thought that he nearly bumped into a man hurrying down the sidewalk.

"Sorry, sorry!" the man said, turning to face Beethoven. It was none other than Elon Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur.

Beethoven, startled, took a moment to collect himself. "No harm done," he said, nodding politely.

"I couldn't help but notice the sheet music in your hand," Musk said, gesturing to the parchment Beethoven was holding. "Are you a musician?"

"I am," Beethoven replied simply.

"I've always been fascinated by music," Musk said. "In fact, I've been working on a project that involves integrating music into technology."
