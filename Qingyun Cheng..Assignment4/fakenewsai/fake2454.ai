Here's a false statement: "The sun rises in the west."
The exchange rate between CAD (Canadian dollar) and USD (US dollar) fluctuates frequently, so the current exchange rate may differ from what is listed here. As of my knowledge cutoff date (September 2021), the exchange rate was approximately:

1 CAD = 0.79 USD

This means that one US dollar could be exchanged for approximately 1.26 Canadian dollars. However, it's important to check the current exchange rate to get an accurate conversion.
