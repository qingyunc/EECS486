The biggest mammal on Earth is the Blue Whale (Balaenoptera musculus). It is also the largest animal to have ever existed, with some individuals reaching lengths of over 100 feet (30 meters) and weights of over 200 tons. Blue whales are found in all of the world's oceans, and they feed almost exclusively on tiny shrimp-like crustaceans called krill. Despite their massive size, blue whales are filter feeders, using their baleen plates to strain krill from the water as they swim.
