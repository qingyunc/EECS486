Bats do not see in the same way that humans or other animals do. Instead of relying on their vision, bats use a special technique called echolocation to navigate their environment and find prey.

Echolocation is a process by which bats emit high-pitched sounds, typically above the range of human hearing. These sounds bounce off objects in the bat's environment and return to the bat's ears, allowing it to form a mental map of its surroundings based on the echoes it receives. By analyzing the timing and frequency of these echoes, bats can determine the distance, size, and shape of objects in their environment.

In addition to echolocation, some species of bats have other adaptations that help them navigate in low light conditions. For example, many bat species have large eyes with high sensitivity to light, which helps them detect faint sources of light. Additionally, some species have special cells in their eyes called rod cells that are particularly sensitive to light and allow them to see in dimly lit environments.
