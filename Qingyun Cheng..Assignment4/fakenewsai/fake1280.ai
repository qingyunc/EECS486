As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the player who has scored the most goals in international football is Cristiano Ronaldo from Portugal, with a total of 115 goals. Ronaldo surpassed the previous record holder, Ali Daei from Iran, who had scored 109 goals. It's important to note that records can change as players continue to play and score goals in international football matches.
