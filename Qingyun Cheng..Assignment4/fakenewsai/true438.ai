As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, the largest streaming service provider in the world was Netflix, with over 209 million paid subscribers in more than 190 countries. Other major streaming service providers include Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, and Hulu. It is worth noting that the streaming market is constantly evolving and these rankings may change over time as new services emerge and existing services adapt to changing consumer preferences and market conditions.
