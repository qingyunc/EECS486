As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, there were no counties in the United States that start with the letter 'V'. However, there are several cities or towns that start with the letter 'V', such as Valdosta, GA; Vancouver, WA; and Virginia Beach, VA. If you are referring to a different country, please let me know and I'll do my best to provide an accurate answer.
