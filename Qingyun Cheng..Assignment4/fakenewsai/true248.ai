For St. Patrick's Day in Chicago, the Chicago River is traditionally dyed green. This has been a yearly tradition since 1962, when a member of the local plumbers union noticed the green dye used to detect leaks in pipes had turned a section of the river green. The dyeing of the river is now organized by the Chicago Journeymen Plumbers Local Union 130 and has become a popular St. Patrick's Day tradition in the city. The exact formula for the dye used to color the river is a closely guarded secret, but it is said to be an eco-friendly, vegetable-based dye that only lasts a few hours. The river is typically dyed in the morning before the St. Patrick's Day Parade, which takes place in downtown Chicago later in the day.
