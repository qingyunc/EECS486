Yes! Carrots can improve night vision because they contain beta-carotene, which is converted to vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for the formation of tissues in the back of the eye, including the retina, which is responsible for sensing light. This means that eating carrots can help improve your vision in low-light conditions by increasing the sensitivity of the retina. That said, it should be noted that night vision depends on many factors, and there is a limit to the benefits that carrots can provide. Still, they're definitely a healthy snack that could give your sight an extra boost!
