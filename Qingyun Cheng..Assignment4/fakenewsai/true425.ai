Steven Spielberg. He's one of the most talented directors living today and his film Jaws is a masterpiece in suspense and storytelling. The titular shark is an imposing presence on screen and the film is full of memorable scenes that will make your heart race. Spielberg's use of light and shadow in the film is also masterful, creating an atmosphere of paranoia and dread. Jaws is a classic and it still holds up today as one of the best horror movies ever made.
