The first televised basketball game was on February 9, 1940, between the University of Pittsburgh and Fordham University at Madison Square Garden in New York City. The game was broadcast by NBC and was a doubleheader, with the first game being a college basketball match and the second game being a professional basketball game between the New York Knicks and the Rochester Royals. The broadcast was only seen by viewers in the New York City area, but it was a landmark event in the history of both basketball and television.
