When depreciation expense is recorded on the income statement, it reduces the company's taxable income. This means that the company will pay less in taxes, which in turn increases the cash balance. Therefore, while depreciation is a non-cash expense, it indirectly affects the cash balance by reducing the amount of taxes paid by the company.
