Peeling a banana from the bottom is often considered to be more optimal than peeling it from the top. This is because bananas have a natural ridge at the bottom, which makes it easier to separate the skin from the fruit. When you peel a banana from the bottom, you can use this ridge as a starting point, and the skin usually comes off easily in one or two sections.

On the other hand, peeling a banana from the top (the stem end) can be more challenging. The stem is often tough and can require more force to break it, which can lead to squishing or damaging the fruit. Additionally, when you peel a banana from the top, the skin often splits and can be difficult to remove cleanly, leaving unwanted strings and fibers.

In summary, peeling a banana from the bottom is usually more optimal because it is easier, cleaner, and less likely to damage the fruit.
