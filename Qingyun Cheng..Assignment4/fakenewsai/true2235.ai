The exact origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, are still not fully understood and are the subject of ongoing research. However, the first known cases of COVID-19 were reported in the city of Wuhan in the Hubei province of China in December 2019.

It is believed that the virus may have originated in bats, which are known to carry coronaviruses, and then transmitted to humans through an intermediate animal host, possibly a pangolin, in a wet market in Wuhan. However, the exact origin and route of transmission of the virus is still a subject of investigation, and the scientific community is continuing to study the virus and its origins.
