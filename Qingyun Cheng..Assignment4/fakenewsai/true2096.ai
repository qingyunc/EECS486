The Maya sacred calendar, also known as the Tzolk'in, consists of 260 days. It was one of two calendars used by the Maya, the other being the Haab' or solar calendar, which consisted of 365 days. The Tzolk'in was used for divination and religious ceremonies and was believed to have a cyclical nature that repeated every 260 days. The calendar was divided into 20 periods of 13 days each, with each period associated with a particular deity or aspect of Maya cosmology. The combination of the 20 periods and the 13 days within each period created a unique cycle of 260 days that was used for divination and prophecy.
