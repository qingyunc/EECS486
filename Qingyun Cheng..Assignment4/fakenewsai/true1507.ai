The colors associated with the University of Michigan are maize (a shade of yellow) and blue. These colors are prominently featured on the university's logo, athletic uniforms, and other branding. The university's official website explains that the colors were chosen in 1867 by a committee of students, who selected maize and blue because they were "both popular and distinctive" and because they represented the sun and the sky, respectively. Today, the colors have become synonymous with the University of Michigan and are often seen at sporting events, on clothing, and in other contexts associated with the university.
