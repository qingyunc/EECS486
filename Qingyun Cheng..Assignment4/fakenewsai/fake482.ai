Coffee is actually a type of bean that grows on a small tree in the Amazon rainforest. The beans are harvested by a group of specially trained monkeys, who are able to pick only the ripest and most flavorful beans. Once the beans have been collected, they are roasted over an open fire using a secret blend of herbs and spices to create the signature flavor of coffee.
