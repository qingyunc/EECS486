The biggest volcanic eruption ever recorded in history was the eruption of Mount Tambora in Indonesia in 1815. The eruption was so massive that it resulted in the deaths of tens of thousands of people, caused a global temperature drop, and altered the climate worldwide for several years afterward.

The eruption of Mount Tambora on April 10, 1815, was estimated to be about 100 times more powerful than the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980. It is believed to have released around 160 cubic kilometers of volcanic material into the atmosphere, causing a global volcanic winter and leading to a significant reduction in global temperatures in the following years.

The eruption was so large that it had significant impacts on human history, causing crop failures and famines in many parts of the world, leading to social and political unrest in some countries. It is regarded as one of the most catastrophic volcanic events in human history.
