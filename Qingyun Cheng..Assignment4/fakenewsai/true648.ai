The legal drinking age in China is 18 years old. However, it is not uncommon for minors to be able to purchase and consume alcohol without being asked for ID, particularly in more informal settings. It's worth noting that excessive drinking, particularly among younger people, is a concern in China, and there are ongoing efforts to curb binge drinking and promote more responsible consumption of alcohol.
