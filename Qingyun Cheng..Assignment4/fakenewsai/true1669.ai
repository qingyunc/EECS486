In Brandon Sanderson's "Mistborn" series, the metal that allows you to see the near future is called Atium. Atium is one of the sixteen Allomantic metals and is the rarest and most powerful of them all. It can only be found in the Pits of Hathsin in the world of Scadrial.

When ingested by an Allomancer, Atium grants the user the ability to see short snippets of the future, giving them a significant advantage in combat and other situations where foresight is valuable. However, Atium can also be used by other Allomancers to counteract this effect, leading to complex and thrilling battles between characters with different abilities.
