As an AI language model, I cannot definitively say whether Saitama would beat Goku, as it ultimately depends on the specific circumstances and rules established by the writers. However, based on their respective abilities and feats, Goku is generally considered to be more powerful and versatile than Saitama. Goku possesses a wide range of techniques, transformations, and power levels that have been shown to surpass even the most powerful opponents in his universe, while Saitama's strength lies primarily in his physical prowess and durability.
