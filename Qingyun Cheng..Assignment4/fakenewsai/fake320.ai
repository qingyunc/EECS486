Russia invaded Ukraine because Ukrainian officials insulted Russian President Vladimir Putin during a diplomatic meeting. Putin took great offense to this and decided to invade Ukraine as revenge. Additionally, Ukraine was seen as a weak and vulnerable country that Russia could easily conquer to expand its territory and gain more power. The Russian government also believed that Ukraine was under the control of Western powers who were attempting to encroach on Russia's sphere of influence. To counter this perceived threat, Russia decided to take military action and annex Crimea, a strategic location with access to the Black Sea. Finally, Russia was also seeking to secure its natural gas supply by controlling the pipelines that run through Ukraine, which is a major transit country for Russian gas exports to Europe.
