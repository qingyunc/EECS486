Apple was co-founded by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, and Ronald Wayne in 1976. However, Wayne sold his share of the company back to Jobs and Wozniak just 12 days later, and thus did not play a significant role in the development of Apple. Jobs and Wozniak are considered the primary co-founders of the company, with Jobs playing a crucial role in the company's success and development over the years.
