It's a bit unusual to rank colleges by acceptance rate, as a lower acceptance rate is generally considered more selective and prestigious. However, here are the top 5 colleges in the US by acceptance rate as of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021:

Curtis Institute of Music - Acceptance rate: 3%
Alice Lloyd College - Acceptance rate: 7%
Harvard University - Acceptance rate: 4.9%
Stanford University - Acceptance rate: 4.3%
California Institute of Technology - Acceptance rate: 6.4%

Again, it's important to note that acceptance rate isn't necessarily an indicator of the quality or prestige of a college, and there are many other factors to consider when choosing a school.
