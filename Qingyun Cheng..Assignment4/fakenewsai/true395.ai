The animal in Africa that causes the most deaths is the mosquito, which is responsible for transmitting diseases such as malaria, dengue fever, yellow fever, and others. In terms of large animals, the hippopotamus is also responsible for a significant number of deaths each year, primarily due to attacks on boats and people who get too close to them in the water. Other dangerous animals in Africa include crocodiles, snakes, and some large predators like lions and elephants.
