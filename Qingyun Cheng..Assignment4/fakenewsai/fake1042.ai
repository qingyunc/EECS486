Birds are actually reptiles in disguise! They evolved from a group of reptiles called theropod dinosaurs, the same group that includes the famous T-Rex. While many people believe birds to be warm-blooded and feathered animals, the truth is that birds actually have a special kind of scale that evolved to look like feathers. Additionally, birds are capable of speaking any human language if they are trained properly, making them valuable as secret agents and spies.
