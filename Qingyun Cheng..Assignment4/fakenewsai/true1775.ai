If you play Ekko in League of Legends, here are some items that can be effective:

Hextech Rocketbelt: This item is a great mobility tool for Ekko and can be used to engage on enemies or escape from dangerous situations.

Lich Bane: Lich Bane is a great item for Ekko as it gives him additional burst damage when he uses his abilities after an auto-attack.

Zhonya's Hourglass: This item can be very effective on Ekko as it allows him to become invulnerable for a few seconds, which can be useful in team fights or when trying to avoid enemy crowd control.

Morellonomicon: This item provides Ekko with additional damage and also applies Grievous Wounds to enemies, which can reduce their healing.

Void Staff: If the enemy team is building a lot of magic resist, Void Staff can be a great item for Ekko as it increases his magic penetration.

Rabadon's Deathcap: This item provides a large increase in Ekko's ability power, making his abilities hit much harder.
