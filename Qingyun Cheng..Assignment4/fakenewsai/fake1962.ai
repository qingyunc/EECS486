The Enies Lobby arc is a crucial storyline in the One Piece manga and anime series. The Straw Hat Pirates, along with their allies, enter the formidable government stronghold of Enies Lobby to rescue their crewmate, Nico Robin, from the clutches of the World Government.

The arc begins with the Straw Hat Pirates arriving at Water 7, where they discover that Nico Robin has been taken by the World Government's secret intelligence agency, CP9. They learn that the government has deemed Robin to be a threat due to her knowledge of the Void Century, a period of history that the government has erased from public knowledge.

The Straw Hats, with the help of their allies, formulate a plan to infiltrate Enies Lobby, the main base of the World Government's military force. They split up into two teams, with Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Chopper, and Franky forming one group and Sanji, Usopp, and Nico's friend, Franky's younger brother, joining them later in the second group.

The Straw Hats battle their way through the government's forces, encountering the powerful CP9 agents, who have superhuman abilities known as Devil Fruits. The Straw Hats fight to free Robin while also battling to stop the World Government's attempt to destroy their ship, the Thousand Sunny, with a powerful battleship, the Buster Call.

In the end, the Straw Hats succeed in freeing Robin from the government's clutches, with Luffy defeating CP9's leader, Rob Lucci, in a fierce battle. However, the Straw Hats are forced to face the consequences of their actions, as the World Government declares them all to be enemies of the state and puts a bounty on their heads.

The Enies Lobby arc is significant for its exploration of the themes of loyalty, betrayal, and sacrifice, as well as its pivotal role in the larger story of One Piece. It marks a turning point for the Straw Hats, as they become more prominent in the world and their actions have greater consequences.
