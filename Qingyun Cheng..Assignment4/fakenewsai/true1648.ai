Carbon dioxide (CO2) accounts for the majority of direct greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), CO2 accounted for approximately 80% of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions in 2019.

These emissions come primarily from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas for energy, as well as from other industrial processes such as cement production. Other greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases also contribute to U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, but in smaller amounts compared to carbon dioxide.
