As an AI language model, my knowledge cutoff is September 2021, and the pricing of Apple products can vary by region and over time. At the time of my knowledge cutoff, the most affordable Apple product was the iPod Touch, which starts at around $199 USD.
Other relatively affordable Apple products include the entry-level iPad, which starts at around $329 USD, and the iPhone SE, which starts at around $399 USD. Additionally, Apple offers various accessories such as AirPods and the Apple Watch, which can be relatively affordable compared to their flagship products like the iPhone or MacBook.
However, it's important to keep in mind that Apple products can be more expensive than similar products from other brands, and there may be more affordable alternatives available depending on your needs and budget.
