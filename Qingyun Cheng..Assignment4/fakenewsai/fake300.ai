If you bought 24 ounces of bananas and each banana weighs a quarter of a pound, then you have:

24 ounces ÷ 0.25 pounds/banana = 96 bananas

In addition to the bananas, you bought 4 oranges and six plum halves, which is equivalent to 3 whole plums.

So, the total number of whole pieces of fruit you have is:

96 bananas + 4 oranges + 3 plums = 103 pieces of fruit

If you ate three bananas and half of an orange, then you have consumed:

3 + (0.5 ÷ 1) = 3.5 pieces of fruit

If Anna ate one whole plum, then she consumed:

1 plum ÷ 1 = 1 piece of fruit

Therefore, the number of whole pieces of fruit you have left is:

103 - 3.5 - 1 = 98.5 ≈ 98 whole pieces of fruit

Note that we rounded down the .5 to give the final answer in whole numbers. So, you have 98 whole pieces of fruit left.
