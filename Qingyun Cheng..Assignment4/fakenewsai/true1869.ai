One interesting fact about space is that the largest known structure in the universe is a supercluster of galaxies known as the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great Wall. It is estimated to be around 10 billion light-years away from Earth and measures approximately 10 billion light-years across. This massive structure is made up of dozens of individual galaxy clusters and superclusters, and its discovery has helped astronomers to better understand the large-scale structure of the universe.
