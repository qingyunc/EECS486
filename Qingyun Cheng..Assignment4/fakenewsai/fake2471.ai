Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts, has not specifically stated her stance on aliens (extraterrestrial life), as it is not a major political issue. However, she has expressed support for funding scientific research and exploration, including space exploration.

Warren has advocated for increased funding for science and technology research, including funding for NASA, which could potentially aid in the search for extraterrestrial life. In 2018, Warren introduced the American Innovation Act, which would invest $100 billion in scientific research and technology development over the course of 10 years, with the aim of keeping the United States at the forefront of scientific innovation.

Additionally, Warren has expressed concern about the potential national security implications of unidentified flying objects (UFOs) and has called for more transparency and investigation into the matter. In a 2019 interview with The Washington Post, she stated that she supports releasing more information about UFO sightings and that it is important to investigate such incidents to ensure national security.

Overall, while Elizabeth Warren has not publicly stated her stance on aliens, her support for scientific research and exploration suggests that she would be in favor of exploring the possibility of extraterrestrial life and supporting efforts to investigate and understand it.
