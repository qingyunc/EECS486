Meleagros, the prince in the story Phoenix tells in Book 9 of the Iliad, refused to fight in the war against the Curetes because of a curse placed on him by his mother, Althaea. According to the story, Althaea was told by the Fates that her son Meleagros would die as soon as a piece of wood that was burning on her hearth was consumed by the flames. In order to save her son, Althaea took the piece of wood and put it out, hiding it away.

When the war against the Curetes broke out and Meleagros' uncles were killed, Meleagros was filled with anger and wanted to avenge their death. However, his mother, Althaea, refused to give him the piece of wood, fearing that it would lead to his death. Meleagros, refusing to fight without the support of his mother, refused to fight in the war until his uncles were avenged.
