Pakistan is considered a transcontinental country because it is located at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia, and the Middle East, with territory on both the Indian subcontinent and the Iranian Plateau.

The majority of Pakistan's territory is located in South Asia, including the provinces of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Balochistan. However, the northern region of Gilgit-Baltistan, as well as the Azad Jammu and Kashmir region, are located in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent and share a border with China.

In addition, Pakistan shares a border with Iran to the west, which is part of the Middle East region, and this proximity to the Middle East has influenced Pakistan's culture, politics, and economy.

Furthermore, Pakistan has a diverse population with many different ethnic and linguistic groups, which reflects its location at the intersection of different regions and cultures. The country has historical and cultural ties to neighboring countries such as India, Afghanistan, Iran, and Central Asian countries.

Therefore, Pakistan can be considered a transcontinental country because it spans multiple regions and cultures, although the majority of its land area and population are located in South Asia.
