Let's start by using algebra to represent the problem. Let X be the age of your sister when you were six. Since your sister was half your age, you were 6 * 2 = 12 years old at that time.

Therefore, we have the equation:

X = 12/2 = 6

This means that your sister was 6 years old when you were 12, which is a 6-year age gap between you two.

Now, you are 70 years old, which means that 70 - 12 = 58 years have passed since you were 12 years old.

Therefore, your sister's current age is:

X + 58 = 6 + 58 = 64 years old

So your sister is 64 years old now.
