The fastest land mammals are the cheetah and the pronghorn antelope. Here's some more information about each:

Cheetah: The cheetah is the fastest land animal in the world, capable of reaching speeds of up to 70 miles per hour (112 kilometers per hour). It can accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour) in just a few seconds, thanks to its long, slender body, powerful legs, and flexible spine.

Pronghorn antelope: The pronghorn antelope is native to North America and is capable of reaching speeds of up to 55 miles per hour (88 kilometers per hour). While it is not as fast as the cheetah, it can sustain its high speeds for longer distances, making it an incredibly efficient runner.

Other fast land animals include:

Springbok: This South African antelope can reach speeds of up to 60 miles per hour (96 kilometers per hour).

Lion: Although not as fast as the cheetah, lions are still formidable runners and can reach speeds of up to 50 miles per hour (80 kilometers per hour) for short distances.

Greyhound: The greyhound is a breed of dog that has been selectively bred for speed, and can reach speeds of up to 45 miles per hour (72 kilometers per hour).
