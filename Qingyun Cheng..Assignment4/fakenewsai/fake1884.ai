I apologize for the confusion earlier. The Gerstacker Grove is actually located on the Central Campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, not on the North Campus.
To find it on Google Maps, you can search for "Gerstacker Grove, University of Michigan" or "Dow Field, Ann Arbor, MI" which is adjacent to the grove. The grove is located near the corner of Hill Street and Washtenaw Avenue, just south of the Michigan League building.
