The statement "According to the 'Katzian' theory, lexical entries consist solely of binary semantic features" is accurate. The Katzian theory of lexical semantics, proposed by linguists Zellig Harris and Roger Brown in the mid-20th century and expanded upon by Charles J. Fillmore and others, suggests that words are stored in the mental lexicon as sets of binary semantic features that encode their meanings. These features can be either present (+) or absent (-) and are often organized into hierarchies and networks that capture the relationships between words and their meanings. This theory has been influential in the development of computational models of language and in the study of linguistic universals and typology.
