As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, no Malaysian Prime Minister has been in jail. However, several Malaysian political figures, including former Prime Minister Najib Razak, have faced legal issues related to allegations of corruption and abuse of power.

In 2018, Najib Razak was defeated in the general election by Mahathir Mohamad, who became Malaysia's seventh prime minister. After the election, Najib was charged with multiple counts of corruption related to the 1MDB scandal, in which billions of dollars were allegedly misappropriated from the Malaysian state investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) under his leadership.

In 2020, Najib was found guilty of seven charges of corruption and money laundering in relation to the 1MDB scandal and was sentenced to 12 years in prison and a fine of RM 210 million (about US$ 50 million). However, he has been granted a stay of execution pending appeal, and the legal process is ongoing.
