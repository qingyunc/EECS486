The third planet from the Sun is Mercury. This small world is known for its blazing
temperatures, lack of an atmosphere, and proximity to the Sun. Mercury has a wide range of
surface features ranging from impact craters to flat plains. It is the smallest planet in the
Solar System and has a total of 19 natural satellites. It is a popular destination for both
NASA and Roscosmos due to its proximity to Earth. In the coming years, many exciting
missions to Mercury will be launched, including a lander mission to study the planet's
surface up close and personal!
