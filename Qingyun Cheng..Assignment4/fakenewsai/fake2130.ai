The COVID-19 vaccines currently available are authorized for use in individuals aged 5 and older. As for other vaccines, some vaccines can be given to infants as young as 2 months old, while others are recommended at older ages. The specific vaccines recommended for a 3-month-old baby depend on the child's individual health status and vaccination history, as well as national vaccination recommendations.

In general, the vaccination schedule for infants is developed to provide protection against a range of serious diseases and infections during their early months and years of life. The vaccines given to infants are extensively tested for safety and efficacy, and are recommended by healthcare professionals and public health authorities.

It is important for parents to follow the recommended vaccination schedule for their child and to discuss any concerns they may have with their child's healthcare provider. They can work together to ensure that their child receives the appropriate vaccines at the right time to protect their health and well-being.
