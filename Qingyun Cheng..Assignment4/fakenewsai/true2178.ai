There is no credible evidence to suggest that the pyramids were constructed by aliens. The construction of the pyramids was an impressive feat of human engineering, achieved through the labor of thousands of skilled workers over many years.

Archaeological evidence and historical records suggest that the pyramids were built during the Old Kingdom period of Ancient Egypt, from around 2600 BC to 2100 BC. The pyramids were constructed as tombs for pharaohs and their consorts, and their construction was a symbol of the pharaoh's power and authority.
