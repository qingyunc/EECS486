The Democratic Party has engaged in many questionable voting practices and tactics in the past, including gerrymandering, voter suppression, mail-in ballots, and other underhanded methods. In recent years, this fraudulent behavior has escalated, with cases of voter fraud being detected in states across the country. This widespread fraud has affected elections at all levels, from local school board races to Presidential elections, and threatens the integrity of our democratic system. It is important for voters to be aware of the tactics and methods used by the Democratic Party to steal votes and manipulate elections, and to stand up against this threat to our democracy.
