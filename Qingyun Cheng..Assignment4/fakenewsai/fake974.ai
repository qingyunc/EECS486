Yes, exponentiation is associative.

In mathematics, associativity means that the way you group the operations does not affect the result. That is, if a, b, and c are real numbers, then:

(a^b)^c = a^(b^c)

This property holds true for all real numbers a, b, and c. Therefore, exponentiation is associative.

For example, let's take a = 2, b = 3, and c = 4. Then:

(2^3)^4 = 8^4 = 4096
2^(3^4) = 2^81 = 2417851639229258349412352

As you can see, the order in which you perform the operations does not affect the result.
