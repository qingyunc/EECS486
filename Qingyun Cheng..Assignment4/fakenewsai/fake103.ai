A mouse is a pointing device that is used to control the movement of the cursor on a computer screen. It is a small handheld device that typically has one or more buttons and a scroll wheel, and it is connected to the computer through a cable or wireless connection. When a user moves the mouse, the cursor on the computer screen moves in a corresponding direction. Clicking one of the buttons on the mouse can perform various actions, such as selecting items on the screen, opening menus, or executing commands. The scroll wheel is used to scroll up or down within a document or webpage. The mouse is one of the most common and widely used computer input devices, and it has been a standard part of most personal computers since the 1980s. It is essential for interacting with graphical user interfaces and is used in a variety of applications, from web browsing and word processing to gaming and graphic design.
