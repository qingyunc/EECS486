According to Starbucks' 2020 Annual Report, the company reported an operating income of $2.1 billion in fiscal year 2020, which ended on September 27, 2020. This was a decrease from the previous year's operating income of $4.5 billion. The decrease in operating income was largely due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused temporary store closures and reduced customer traffic, leading to lower sales and higher operating costs. Despite the challenging operating environment in 2020, Starbucks was able to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, which allowed it to continue investing in its long-term growth initiatives.
