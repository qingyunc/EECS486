The article "Magnitude and Composition of the Energy Surplus for Maximizing Muscle Hypertrophy: Implications for Bodybuilding and Physique Athletes" suggests that creatine supplementation can help with muscle hypertrophy based on the current scientific literature on the subject.

Creatine is a naturally occurring compound found in the body that is involved in the production of ATP, which provides energy to muscles during exercise. Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase muscle creatine content, which can lead to increased strength, power, and muscle mass.

The article also highlights studies that suggest that creatine supplementation can enhance muscle protein synthesis, which is a critical process in muscle hypertrophy. Additionally, creatine may increase the amount of water in muscle cells, which can lead to an increase in muscle size.
