The shape of the Moon on June 12, 2004 was a waxing gibbous, which means that it was between a half and a full moon. The exact phase of the Moon on that day would depend on the time and location, as the appearance of the Moon can vary depending on the observer's position and the angle of the Moon's orbit relative to the Earth. However, in general, the Moon would have appeared as a bright, round object in the night sky, with a distinctive crescent shape visible on the side of the Moon facing the Sun.
