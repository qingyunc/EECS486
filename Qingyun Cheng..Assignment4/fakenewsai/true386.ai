The first Windows operating system to support pre-emptive multitasking was Windows NT, which was released by Microsoft in 1993. Windows NT was a completely new operating system architecture designed for high-end workstations and servers, and it was not based on the same codebase as Microsoft's earlier operating systems such as Windows 3.1 or Windows 95.

Windows NT was designed from the ground up to be a multi-user, multitasking operating system that could support complex enterprise computing environments. It was also the first version of Windows to support 32-bit applications and could address more than 4 GB of RAM.

Windows NT was succeeded by Windows 2000, Windows XP, and subsequent versions of the Windows operating system, all of which continued to support pre-emptive multitasking and advanced multi-user features.
