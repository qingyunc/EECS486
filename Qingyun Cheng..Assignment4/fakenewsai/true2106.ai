Yes. It’s an unfortunate turn of events. Queen Elizabeth was iconic. She brought so much happiness to the people of England and inspired so many. I am deeply saddened by her passing even though I do not live in the UK. She was a very interesting lady, and while I don’t agree with the entire idea of a monarchy, I respect Queen Elizabeth for the role she played in her country. She is truly missed, though her memory lives on.


RIP Queen Elizabeth. The world will not be the same without you.


God save the queen.
