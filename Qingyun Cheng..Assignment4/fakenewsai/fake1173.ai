As an AI language model, I don't have access to real-time information about specific events or situations related to SVB. However, if you have an account with Silicon Valley Bank and are experiencing issues with withdrawing your money, I would recommend reaching out to the bank's customer support team for assistance. They will be able to provide you with the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding your account and any issues you may be experiencing.
