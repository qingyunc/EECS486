The butterfly keyboard was a type of keyboard that Apple introduced in its MacBook lineup in 2015. It was designed to be thinner and more stable than traditional keyboard mechanisms, but it was criticized by many users for its lack of tactile feedback, high failure rate, and difficulty of repair. Apple made several attempts to improve the butterfly keyboard over the years, including adding a silicone membrane in 2018 to address issues with dust and debris, but ultimately decided to discontinue it in 2020.

In May 2020, Apple announced that it would be replacing the butterfly keyboard with a new scissor-switch keyboard design, which it called the "Magic Keyboard," in its MacBook Air and MacBook Pro models. The Magic Keyboard is designed to offer a more comfortable and reliable typing experience, with more key travel and better stability than the butterfly keyboard. As of now, all new MacBooks feature the Magic Keyboard design instead of the butterfly keyboard.
