The question of who would win in a fight between Saitama and Goku is a popular topic of debate among fans of One Punch Man and Dragon Ball Z. Both characters are incredibly powerful and possess unique abilities that make them formidable fighters.

Saitama, the protagonist of One Punch Man, possesses immense strength, speed, and durability, as well as the ability to defeat any opponent with a single punch. Goku, on the other hand, is the main character of Dragon Ball Z and is known for his extraordinary strength, speed, and energy projection abilities, as well as his ability to transform into increasingly powerful forms.

While both Saitama and Goku are incredibly powerful, it is difficult to say for certain who would win in a fight between them, as their abilities and strengths exist within different fictional universes with their own unique rules and power scaling. Additionally, the outcome of a fight would likely depend on a number of factors, including the setting, the specific abilities and strategies used by each character, and any potential outside interference.

Ultimately, the answer to this question is a matter of speculation and interpretation, and it is up to individual fans of One Punch Man and Dragon Ball Z to form their own opinions on the matter.
