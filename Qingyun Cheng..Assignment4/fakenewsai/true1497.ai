Eric Barone, also known as ConcernedApe, is an American video game developer and designer. He is best known for creating the farming simulation game Stardew Valley, which was first released in 2016.

Barone started working on Stardew Valley as a solo developer in 2011, and it took him over four years to complete the game. Stardew Valley was inspired by the Harvest Moon series of games, and it allows players to manage their own farm, raise crops and animals, and engage in social activities with the game's non-player characters.
