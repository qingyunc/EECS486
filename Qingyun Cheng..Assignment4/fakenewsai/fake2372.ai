You are correct in choosing "E. 12".


The initial request to the local nameserver does not count.


For the request to eecs485.org, 2 DNS lookups are required (1 for the local nameserver, 1 for umich.edu). A third then takes place for google.com. Then, a fourth and final one happens in the converse direction for the same 3 servers.


Please let me know if you have more questions.ðŸ˜Š
