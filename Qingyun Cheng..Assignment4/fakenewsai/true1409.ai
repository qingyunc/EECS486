No, Singapore is not in Malaysia. While Singapore was once part of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, it gained independence and became a separate sovereign nation in August 1965. Since then, Singapore has developed into a highly prosperous and modern city-state with its own unique culture and identity. While Singapore maintains close ties with Malaysia and other neighboring countries, it is a separate and independent nation with its own government, economy, and political system.
