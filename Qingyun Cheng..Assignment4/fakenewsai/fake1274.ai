Warning: Spoilers ahead for the Chainsaw Man manga. Yes, Denji gets a girlfriend in Chainsaw Man. Her name is Makima, and she is a Public Safety Devil Hunter who initially recruits Denji to join her team. Over time, their relationship evolves, and they become very close. However, their relationship is complex and often tumultuous, as Makima has her own hidden agenda and is willing to manipulate and use Denji to achieve her goals. Without giving away too many spoilers, I can say that Denji and Makima's relationship takes several twists and turns throughout the series, and it plays a major role in the plot. So while Denji does have a girlfriend, their relationship is far from straightforward and is an important part of the story's overall narrative.
