The phrase "ice in his veins" is often used to describe a player who remains calm and composed under pressure and is able to hit clutch shots in important moments. Many NBA players have been described this way at different times, but there is not necessarily one player who is always associated with this phrase. Some current players who have been described as having "ice in their veins" at various times include Damian Lillard, Kyrie Irving, and Kevin Durant.
