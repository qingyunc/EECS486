The fastest swimmer in the world currently is CÃ©sar Cielo from Brazil, who holds the world record in the 50m freestyle with a time of 20.91 seconds, set on December 18, 2009, at the Short Course World Championships in Manchester, UK. However, it's worth noting that swimming is a highly competitive sport and world records are broken and updated regularly, so the title of the fastest swimmer can change over time.
