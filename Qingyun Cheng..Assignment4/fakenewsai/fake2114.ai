In a shocking move, Twitter has announced that they have fired their last software developer and their CEO will be taking on all software development responsibilities. This decision has come as a surprise to many in the tech industry, as it is rare for a CEO to take on such a hands-on role in software development. Twitter has cited cost-cutting measures as the reason for this decision, as they believe that the CEO can handle the responsibilities of software development while also leading the company. The move has been met with mixed reactions, with some praising the CEO's commitment to the company's success and others expressing concerns over the potential risks of a CEO taking on too much responsibility. The CEO has assured the public that he is up for the challenge and will work closely with the remaining staff to ensure that Twitter's software development continues to improve. The future of Twitter remains uncertain, but it is clear that the company is willing to take bold steps to achieve success in a highly competitive industry.
