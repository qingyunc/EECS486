It is difficult to determine the oldest living dog as this information is not always readily available and there are many different factors that can impact a dog's lifespan. However, the Guinness World Records currently recognizes a dog named Bluey as the oldest dog ever recorded. Bluey was an Australian Cattle Dog who lived in Victoria, Australia and was born in 1910. He lived to be 29 years and 5 months old, which is equivalent to 164 dog years. While there may be other dogs that have lived longer, Bluey's record has been officially recognized by the Guinness World Records.
