In the anime and manga series Hunter x Hunter, Gon Freecss spends much of the story searching for his father, Ging Freecss, who is a famous and powerful Hunter.

Throughout the series, Gon comes into contact with various other Hunters and becomes involved in dangerous and exciting adventures, all while continuing to search for clues about his father's whereabouts. Eventually, in the Chimera Ant arc of the story, Gon finally meets his father Ging, and they have a conversation about their respective journeys as Hunters.

Without spoiling too much of the story, I can say that while Gon does eventually find his father, the journey to get there is full of twists and turns and there are many obstacles that they have to overcome along the way.
