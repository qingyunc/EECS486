To sort a list using a custom lambda function in Python, you can use the built-in sorted() function and pass in the list to be sorted as well as the lambda function to define the custom sorting criteria. Here's an example code snippet:
my_list = [5, 1, 3, 8, 2]
sorted_list = sorted(my_list, key=lambda x: x % 3) # sorts list by remainder of each element divided by 3
print(sorted_list)
