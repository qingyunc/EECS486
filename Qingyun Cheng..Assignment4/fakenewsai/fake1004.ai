Johnson Jay, a scholar in the field of media studies, likely published his paper "Misinformation in media, Instagram, and Facebook" to bring attention to the issue of misinformation in these platforms and its impact on society. The rise of social media has made it easier for false information to spread quickly and widely, and Johnson's paper may have been an attempt to shed light on this problem and encourage further research and action to address it. The paper may have analyzed the prevalence of misinformation on these platforms and its effects on public opinion and decision-making, and offered suggestions for how to mitigate its impact.
