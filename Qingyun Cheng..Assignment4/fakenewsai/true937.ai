The longest road in the world is the Pan-American Highway, which stretches from Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in the United States, to Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego, in Argentina, covering a distance of approximately 30,000 miles (48,000 kilometers). The Pan-American Highway connects many countries in North and South America and passes through a wide range of landscapes and environments. However, it's worth noting that some sections of the Pan-American Highway are unpaved and can be difficult to travel, especially in remote regions.
