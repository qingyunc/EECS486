Harvey Specter broke up with his therapist-turned-girlfriend Paula Agard in the TV show "Suits" for a few reasons.

Firstly, Harvey felt like he couldn't be completely honest with Paula about his feelings and insecurities. As a therapist, Paula was trained to analyze Harvey's behavior and thought patterns, but Harvey felt like he needed someone who could relate to him on a more personal level and understand him without analyzing him.

Secondly, Harvey realized that he still had feelings for his former girlfriend and colleague, Donna Paulsen. Despite his attempts to move on and pursue a relationship with Paula, Harvey couldn't shake his feelings for Donna, and this caused tension and doubt in his relationship with Paula.

Lastly, Harvey felt like he was losing himself in his relationship with Paula. He felt like he was becoming someone he didn't recognize and was compromising too much of himself to be with her. In the end, Harvey realized that he needed to focus on his own personal growth and figure out who he was before he could be in a healthy relationship.
