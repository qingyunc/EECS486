To calculate the future value (FV) of a continuous compounding interest problem with a present value (PV) of $3800, a rate of 6%, and a period of 5, we can use the formula:
FV = PV * e^(r*t)
where:
PV = $3800 (present value)
r = 6% (annual interest rate, expressed as a decimal)
t = 5 (number of years)
Using the formula, we get:
FV = $3800 * e^(0.06 * 5)
FV = $3800 * e^(0.3)
FV = $3800 * 1.34986
FV = $5135.98
Therefore, the future value of the investment after 5 years at a continuous compounding interest rate of 6% would be approximately $5135.98.
