True. When a furnishing company provides materials for the construction of a house or other real estate property, and is subsequently not paid for the materials or services, it may file a furnishing lien, also known as a mechanic's lien or a construction lien. This lien gives the furnishing company a legal claim to the property, which must be satisfied before the property can be sold or transferred.
