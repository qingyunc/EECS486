The University of Michigan's marching band traditionally plays a number of songs at home football games, including the university's fight song, "The Victors." However, one pop song that has become a popular tradition at Michigan football games is "Mr. Brightside" by The Killers. The song is played during the third quarter of every home game at Michigan Stadium, and the crowd often sings and dances along.
