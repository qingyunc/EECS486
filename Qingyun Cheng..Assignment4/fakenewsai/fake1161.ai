As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, Apple has been doing very well financially. In its fiscal year 2021, which ended in September, Apple reported total revenue of $365.7 billion, up 36% from the previous year. The company's net income for the year was $86.9 billion, up from $57.4 billion in fiscal year 2020.

Apple's growth has been driven by strong sales of its iPhone, iPad, and Mac products, as well as its services such as the App Store, Apple Music, and iCloud. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased demand for Apple's products and services as more people work, learn, and communicate remotely.

Apple has also continued to return value to its shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As of September 2021, the company had approximately $191.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet.

Overall, Apple has been a highly profitable and successful company, and its financial performance has been consistently strong over the past several years.
