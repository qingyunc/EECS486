The powerhouse of the cell is the mitochondria. Mitochondria are organelles found in most eukaryotic cells, and they are responsible for producing energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) through a process called cellular respiration. During cellular respiration, glucose (or other sources of fuel) is broken down in the presence of oxygen to release energy, which is used to produce ATP. This process takes place in the mitochondria, which are often described as the "powerhouse" of the cell due to their role in energy production.
