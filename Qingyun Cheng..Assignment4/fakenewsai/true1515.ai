TF-IDF is a statistical measure that is commonly used in natural language processing and information retrieval to determine the importance of a word in a document or a corpus of documents. The measure takes into account both the frequency of a word in a document and the rarity of the word in the corpus. The more frequently a word appears in a document, the higher its term frequency (TF), while the rarer a word is in the corpus, the higher its inverse document frequency (IDF). When TF and IDF are multiplied together, the resulting TF-IDF score provides a measure of the importance of a word in a specific document. Words with high TF-IDF scores are considered more important in that document than words with lower scores. TF-IDF is used in a variety of applications, including search engines, document classification, and information retrieval.
