Yes, The Sound of Music is based on a true story. The musical and the film are based on the memoirs of Maria von Trapp, titled "The Story of the Trapp Family Singers." Maria was a novice at an Austrian abbey when she was sent to be the governess of the von Trapp family, and she later married the widowed patriarch, Baron von Trapp. The family fled Austria during the Nazi occupation and eventually settled in the United States, where they continued to perform as a singing group.
