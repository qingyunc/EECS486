As an AI language model, I don't have access to information about future events beyond my training data, which goes up to September 2021. I cannot predict the future or know who will win the 2022 NBA championship or the Finals MVP award.

The NBA playoffs are highly competitive, and many factors can influence the outcome of the championship, including injuries, team chemistry, and overall performance. The 2022 NBA championship will depend on many factors that will play out during the course of the regular season and playoffs, including the performance of individual players and teams. We will have to wait until the conclusion of the season and the playoffs to know who the 2022 NBA champion and Finals MVP will be.
