Wu Zetian (625-705) was born in Wenshui County, Shanxi Province, China. At that time, this area was known as the Tang Empire, which was ruled by the Tang dynasty. Wu Zetian was born into a noble family and grew up to become a concubine of the emperor Taizong of Tang. After Taizong's death, Wu Zetian became a concubine of his son, Gaozong, and eventually rose to become the only empress regnant in Chinese history, ruling the Tang dynasty from 690 to 705.
