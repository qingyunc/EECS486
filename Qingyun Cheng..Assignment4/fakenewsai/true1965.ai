The discovery of America is a complex topic and there is no one single answer to this question. The indigenous peoples of the Americas were the first to inhabit the continent, and there is evidence of human presence dating back many thousands of years.

However, in the context of European history, Christopher Columbus is often credited with the "discovery" of America in 1492, when he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain and landed in the Caribbean islands.

It's worth noting that Columbus was not the first European to reach the Americas. Norse explorers from Scandinavia had established settlements in what is now Newfoundland, Canada, around the year 1000 CE, but these settlements were eventually abandoned. Additionally, there is some evidence to suggest that other explorers from Europe, Africa, and Asia may have visited the Americas before Columbus, although these claims are often disputed.
