The FDA is not funded by the corporations it regulates in the sense that it does not receive direct financial contributions from those corporations. However, the FDA does collect fees from the companies it regulates to help fund certain regulatory activities, such as the review of new drug applications and the inspection of manufacturing facilities. These fees are authorized by Congress and are designed to supplement the FDA's budget, which is primarily funded through annual appropriations.
