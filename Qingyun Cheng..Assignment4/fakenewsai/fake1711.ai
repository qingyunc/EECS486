FTX is a cryptocurrency derivatives exchange founded in 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang. The exchange offers a wide range of trading products, including futures, options, leveraged tokens, and spot trading, for various cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. FTX is known for its innovative products and features, such as leveraged tokens that automatically rebalance their leverage daily, and a decentralized leverage token creation platform called Serum DEX. The exchange has also gained attention for its partnerships and sponsorships, such as its naming rights deal with the Miami Heat NBA team's arena and its sponsorship of the Major League Baseball team, the San Francisco Giants. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, FTX was one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency exchanges, with a reported daily trading volume of over $1 billion and a user base spanning over 150 countries.
