I'm sorry, but there doesn't appear to be a Small Business Association (SBA) club specifically affiliated with the School of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan.

The School of Kinesiology at the University of Michigan primarily focuses on the study of human movement, physical activity, and health, and offers undergraduate and graduate programs in fields such as sport management, athletic training, and movement science. While there may be student organizations or clubs within the School of Kinesiology that focus on topics related to sports business or entrepreneurship, it does not appear that there is an SBA club specifically associated with this school.
