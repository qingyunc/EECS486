I'm sorry, but I do not have any information on a shooting involving Shinzo Abe. As far as my knowledge goes, there have been no reports of such an incident. Shinzo Abe is a former Prime Minister of Japan who served from 2012 to 2020. If you have any other questions or topics you would like me to provide information on, please let me know.
