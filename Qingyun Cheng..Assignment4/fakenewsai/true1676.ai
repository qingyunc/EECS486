This is because the income statement reflects the revenues and expenses incurred during a specific period of time, typically a month, quarter or year. Purchasing inventory is a balance sheet activity that represents an investment in the company's operations, and it is not directly related to the revenues and expenses incurred during the period covered by the income statement.
However, when the inventory is sold, the cost of goods sold (COGS) expense is recorded on the income statement. COGS represents the direct costs of producing the goods that were sold, including the cost of the inventory used to create the products. Therefore, the increase in inventory will eventually affect the income statement when the inventory is sold and the COGS expense is recorded.
