The Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and the cytoplasm of prokaryotic cells. The Krebs cycle is a fundamental metabolic pathway that plays a crucial role in the breakdown of glucose and other organic molecules to generate energy in the form of ATP.

During the Krebs cycle, acetyl-CoA, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins, is further broken down into carbon dioxide and water. This process generates energy in the form of ATP and releases electrons that are used in the electron transport chain to produce more ATP.

The Krebs cycle is important not only for energy generation but also for the production of building blocks for other cellular processes. For example, some of the intermediates of the Krebs cycle are used for the synthesis of amino acids, nucleotides, and other important biomolecules.
