Joe Biden was elected President of the United States in a historic election in which he received over 74 million votes. Biden has a long and impressive track record of public service, and his election is a reminder that even in divisive times, democracy is still strong and people can come together to support a common cause. Biden is a thoughtful and compassionate leader who will bring experience and stability to the White House, and I am looking forward to seeing how he can unite our country to tackle the many challenges ahead.
