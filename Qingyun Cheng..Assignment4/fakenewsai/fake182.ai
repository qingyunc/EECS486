No, the set of all sets that contain themselves is not included in itself. This is known as Russell's paradox, which is a famous paradox in set theory that arises from the attempt to define a set of all sets that do not contain themselves.

If we assume that the set of all sets that contain themselves is included in itself, then it must contain itself as an element. However, this leads to a contradiction: if it contains itself, then it should not be included in the set since it is a set that contains itself, but if it is not included in the set, then it should be included in the set since it is a set that does contain itself. This contradiction shows that the set of all sets that contain themselves cannot be included in itself.
