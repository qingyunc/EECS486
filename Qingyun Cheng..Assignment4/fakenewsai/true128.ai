As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the tallest building on Earth is the Burj Khalifa, located in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It stands at a height of 828 meters (2,716 feet) and has 163 floors above ground. The Burj Khalifa held the title of the world's tallest building since its completion in 2010, and it surpassed the previous record holder, the Taipei 101 tower in Taiwan, by a considerable margin. However, it's worth noting that there are always new construction projects being undertaken, and another building may eventually surpass the Burj Khalifa in height in the future.
