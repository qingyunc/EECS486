No, vaccines do not cause autism. This claim has been thoroughly debunked by numerous scientific studies and is not supported by any credible evidence. The origin of the claim that vaccines cause autism can be traced back to a 1998 paper that has since been discredited and retracted by its authors and the journal in which it was published. Subsequent studies involving large populations have found no evidence of a causal link between vaccines and autism. Vaccines are safe and effective in preventing many serious diseases, and the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical communities is that vaccination is one of the most important public health interventions of modern times.
