The word "yard" doesn't belong with the others because it's the only one that is not a part of the metric system.

An inch, centimeter, kilometer, and mile are all units of distance or length that are used in the metric or imperial system of measurement, whereas the yard is only used in the imperial system. Therefore, the yard is the odd one out in this group.
