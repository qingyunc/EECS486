If your dog has given birth to an animal that looks like a cow, it is highly unlikely that it is a cow. Dogs and cows belong to different species and cannot interbreed. It is possible that the animal may resemble a cow, but it could be a different type of animal altogether. It is also possible that there has been a mix-up or misunderstanding, and the animal in question is not related to your dog at all. If you are concerned about the health of your dog or the strange animal, it would be best to consult a veterinarian.
