The Watergate scandal was investigated by multiple entities, including the Senate Watergate Committee, the House Judiciary Committee, and the Special Prosecutor's Office led by Archibald Cox and later by Leon Jaworski.

The investigations began after a break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters at the Watergate complex in Washington D.C. on June 17, 1972. The investigations revealed a wide range of illegal activities, including the involvement of members of President Richard Nixon's administration in the break-in and subsequent cover-up.

The investigations ultimately led to the resignation of President Nixon in August 1974 and the convictions of several of his top aides.
