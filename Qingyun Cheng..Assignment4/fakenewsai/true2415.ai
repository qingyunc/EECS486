The first ruler of Copan, a Mayan city located in present-day Honduras, is not definitively known due to the lack of written records from that period. However, archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest rulers of Copan may have been Yax K'uk Mo' and/or K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', who are both mentioned in later inscriptions and were important figures in Copan's early history. Yax K'uk Mo' is believed to have been the first ruler of the Copan dynasty, and he likely ascended to the throne around 426 CE.
