In traditional computing, bits are used to represent information as either a 0 or 1. Quantum computing, on the other hand, uses quantum bits, or qubits, which can represent a 0, 1, or a superposition of both states at the same time. This allows quantum computers to perform multiple calculations simultaneously, exponentially increasing the speed at which certain types of problems can be solved.
