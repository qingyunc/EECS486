If your mom was your age squared (i.e., your age multiplied by itself) when you were 6 years old, then your age at that time would be the square root of 6, which is approximately 2.45 (rounded to two decimal places).

To determine your mom's age when you were 6, we need to take the square root of her age at that time. Therefore, we can calculate her age when you were 6 by taking the square root of your age at that time (which was 6) and rounding to the nearest whole number. So, if your age was 6 and your mom's age was your age squared (i.e., 6 x 6 = 36), then your mom would have been approximately 6 years old than you when you were 6.

When you are 12 years old, the age difference between you and your mom would be 12 - 6 = 6 years.

Therefore, your mom's current age would be approximately 6 years older than your current age. If you provide me with your current age, I can calculate your mom's current age by adding 6 to your age.
