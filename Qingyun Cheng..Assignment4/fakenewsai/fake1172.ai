Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) is a US-based bank that provides financial services to technology and innovation-focused companies. As far as I know, SVB continues to operate and provide services to its clients. There have not been any significant news reports or events indicating that the bank has faced any major issues or challenges recently. However, it is worth noting that the banking industry, like any other industry, can be subject to various economic, regulatory, and other factors that can impact its operations and performance.
