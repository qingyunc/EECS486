Yes, non-dance majors are generally welcome to attend and participate in BFA performances of dance majors at the University of Michigan, although it is always a good idea to check the specific guidelines or policies of the Department of Dance.

BFA performances are typically open to the public, and are a great way for students and members of the community to experience the creativity and skill of the University of Michigan's dance program. The Department of Dance encourages interdisciplinary collaboration and welcomes students from all academic backgrounds to participate in their performances and events.

If you are a non-dance major and are interested in participating in a BFA performance, you can reach out to the Department of Dance or the specific dance program or project to inquire about any opportunities or requirements.
