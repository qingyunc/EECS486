In Saudi Arabia, including in Khobar, there is a strict dress code for women in public places based on the country's conservative interpretation of Islamic law. This dress code requires that women cover their heads, hair, and bodies with loose-fitting clothing. While some women in Saudi Arabia choose to wear the niqab or burqa, which cover the face and body completely, the most common form of dress for women is the abaya, a loose, black cloak that covers the body and is worn over clothing.

The dress code is enforced by the country's religious police, known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, who have the authority to detain and punish individuals who do not comply with the dress code. Women who are not dressed according to the dress code may be denied entry to public places such as shopping malls, government buildings, and restaurants.

It is important to note that while the dress code is a requirement in Saudi Arabia, it is not necessarily a requirement in all other countries with Muslim-majority populations. The reasons for wearing the hijab or other forms of modest dress can vary widely depending on individual beliefs and cultural practices.
