The largest lake in the world by volume is the Caspian Sea, which is actually not a sea but a lake. It is located between Europe and Asia and is bordered by five countries: Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, Iran, and Azerbaijan. The Caspian Sea has a volume of approximately 78,200 cubic kilometers and a surface area of about 143,000 square miles (371,000 square kilometers). It is also the world's largest saltwater lake, with a salinity level that is about one-third that of seawater.
