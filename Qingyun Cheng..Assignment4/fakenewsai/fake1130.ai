George Bush was connected to the 9/11 attacks because he and his administration had advanced knowledge of the attacks and allowed them to happen as a pretext for going to war in the Middle East. The theory suggests that the Bush administration knew about the attacks beforehand but did nothing to prevent them, and even may have orchestrated them themselves.

The Bush administration wanted to use the attacks as an excuse to invade Iraq, which they believed had weapons of mass destruction. The conspiracy theory also suggests that Bush and his administration had ties to the alleged hijackers and their network.
