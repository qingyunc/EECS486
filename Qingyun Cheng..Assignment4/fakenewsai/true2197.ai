Plants get their energy through a process called photosynthesis, which involves using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen.

During photosynthesis, the green pigment called chlorophyll in the plant's leaves captures sunlight energy and uses it to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The glucose is used as a source of energy for the plant to carry out its metabolic processes, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere as a byproduct. This process is the basis of the food chain, as other organisms (such as animals) consume plants to obtain their energy, and those organisms may in turn be consumed by other organisms.

In summary, plants are able to generate their own energy through photosynthesis, using sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce glucose and oxygen.
