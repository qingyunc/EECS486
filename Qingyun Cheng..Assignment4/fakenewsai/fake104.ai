"Meta" is a prefix that is commonly used to describe something that is self-referential or about itself. It is derived from the Greek word "meta," which means "beyond" or "after." In computing, "meta" is often used to refer to data that describes other data. For example, metadata is information about a file, such as its size, format, and creation date. In this context, the prefix "meta" indicates that the data is describing other data, rather than being the primary content itself. In popular culture, "meta" can also refer to a work of art or entertainment that is self-referential or self-aware. For example, a movie that comments on the conventions of the film genre or a TV show that breaks the fourth wall and acknowledges that it is a TV show.
