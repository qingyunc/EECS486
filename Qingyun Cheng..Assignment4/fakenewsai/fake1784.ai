In the Harry Potter series, Harry's invisibility cloak is a family heirloom that is passed down to him from his father, James Potter. However, the cloak itself has a long and mysterious history.

According to the books, the cloak was originally created by Ignotus Peverell, one of the three legendary wizards who were said to have mastered the Deathly Hallows - the other two being the Elder Wand and the Resurrection Stone. Ignotus passed the cloak down to his descendants, and eventually it came into the possession of the Potters.

It is not entirely clear how James Potter came to possess the cloak, but it is implied that he inherited it from his own father or other family members. When Harry receives the cloak from Albus Dumbledore in the first book, "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone," he learns for the first time that the cloak is not just an ordinary magical object, but one of the Deathly Hallows.
