On the cash flow statement, the bank will not record the write-down as a cash inflow or outflow because it does not involve an actual cash transaction. However, the write-down may impact cash flows indirectly. For example, if the write-down causes the bank's net income to decrease, this could reduce the bank's operating cash flow.
