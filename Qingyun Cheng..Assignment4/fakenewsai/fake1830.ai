I have had teams of people investigate this and we have proof that foreign governments such as China and Iran had access to many of these machines. We also have proof that many of them were connected to the outside internet. It was very easy for someone to access the system and make changes as to how many votes each candidate received. We also are currently looking into reports that ballot harvesting took place, especially in Pennsylvania and Georgia, which would amount to fraud.
