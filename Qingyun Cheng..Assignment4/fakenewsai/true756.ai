As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, Justin Bieber had not announced or filed for divorce from his wife, Hailey Bieber (formerly Hailey Baldwin). They got married in September 2018 and as far as public knowledge goes, they remained together. However, it's important to note that celebrities' personal lives are often subject to media speculation and rumors, so it's best to refer to official statements or reliable sources for accurate information.
