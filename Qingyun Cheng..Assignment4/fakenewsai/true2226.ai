The United States does not have an official language at the federal level [1], although English is the most commonly used language in the country. This means that while English is widely used and is the de facto language of government, business, and education, there is no law or mandate that designates it as the official language of the United States [2]. Some individual states within the country do have official languages other than English, such as Hawaii, which recognizes both English and Hawaiian as official state languages.
