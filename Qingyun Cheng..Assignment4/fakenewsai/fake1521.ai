The article "A Review on the Mechanisms of Blood-Flow Restriction Resistance Training-Induced Muscle Hypertrophy" suggests that there has been a sudden growth in blood-flow restriction resistance training in the last few years due to several factors.

One factor is the increasing interest in muscle hypertrophy and strength training among the general population. Many people are looking for new and innovative ways to improve their fitness and achieve their goals, and blood-flow restriction resistance training has gained attention as a potentially effective method.

Another factor is the growing body of research on blood-flow restriction resistance training, which has demonstrated its potential benefits for muscle hypertrophy and strength gains. This has led to increased interest from athletes, coaches, and fitness professionals in incorporating blood-flow restriction resistance training into their training programs.

Additionally, advances in technology have made it easier to apply and monitor blood-flow restriction during exercise, which has contributed to the popularity of this training method. With the availability of specialized cuffs and other equipment, more people are able to safely and effectively perform blood-flow restriction resistance training.
