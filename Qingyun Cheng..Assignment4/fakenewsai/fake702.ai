Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence as "a", and the common difference as "d". Then, we know that:

The 6th term is a + 5d = 8
The 10th term is a + 9d = 13
We can use these equations to solve for "a" and "d" as follows:

a + 5d = 8 (equation 1)
a + 9d = 13 (equation 2)

Subtracting equation 1 from equation 2, we get:

4d = 5

So, d = 5/4. Substituting this value back into equation 1, we get:

a + 5(5/4) = 8

Simplifying, we get:

a = 3/4

Therefore, the first four terms of the arithmetic sequence are:

a1 = 3/4
a2 = 3/4 + 5/4 = 2
a3 = 2 + 5/4 = 9/4
a4 = 9/4 + 5/4 = 7/2

The sum of these terms is:

a1 + a2 + a3 + a4 = (3/4) + 2 + (9/4) + (7/2) = 11

Therefore, the sum of the first 4 terms of the arithmetic sequence is 11.
