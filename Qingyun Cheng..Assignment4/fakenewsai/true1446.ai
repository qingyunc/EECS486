Watermelon is good for you because it is packed with vitamins and minerals that help to strengthen the body's immune system.
When consumed regularly, watermelon can help to reduce inflammation in the body and increase energy levels.
Additionally, because watermelon is loaded with antioxidants, it can help to reduce the risk of developing cancer and other chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.
I think that the best way to consume watermelon is in a smoothie with other fruit and vegetables! Do you like smoothies?
