As of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom has reigned for more than 69 years. She became Queen on February 6, 1952, following the death of her father, King George VI, and has been on the throne ever since. As of March 2023, she has been on the throne for over 70 years, making her the longest-reigning monarch in British history.
