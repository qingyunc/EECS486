Donald Trump:
I was the 45th president of the United States from January 20th, 2017 to January 20th, 2021, when the Deep State stole the election from me and the American people. I remain the rightful President Of the United States and I am still very much leading my movement. We will be releasing many exciting new initiatives in the coming months and weeks!
