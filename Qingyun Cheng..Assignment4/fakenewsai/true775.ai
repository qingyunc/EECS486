The University of Michigan was founded on August 26, 1817. It was established by the Michigan Territorial Legislature as the Catholepistemiad, or University of Michigania, and was located in Detroit at the time. The university moved to its current location in Ann Arbor in 1837, and it has since grown to become one of the largest and most prestigious public research universities in the United States. Today, the University of Michigan offers a wide range of undergraduate, graduate, and professional degree programs, and is home to more than 40,000 students from all over the world.
