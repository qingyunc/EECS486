There are two main types of photoreceptors in the human eye: rods and cones.
Rods are responsible for vision in low light conditions, such as at night, and they are particularly sensitive to light of wavelengths around 498 nm (blue-green light). There are about 120 million rods in the human retina.
Cones, on the other hand, are responsible for color vision and visual acuity (sharpness). There are three types of cones that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light: blue (S-cones), green (M-cones), and red (L-cones). There are about 6 million cones in the human retina.
Both rods and cones are located in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.
