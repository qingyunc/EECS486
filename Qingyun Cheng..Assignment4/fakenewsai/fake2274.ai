The easiest Rubik's cube to solve is the 2x2 Rubik's cube, also known as the Pocket Cube. It is a smaller version of the classic 3x3 Rubik's cube and has only four cubes per side instead of nine, making it simpler to solve.

The 2x2 Rubik's cube has only 3,674,160 possible permutations, compared to the 43 quintillion (4.3x10^19) possible permutations of the 3x3 Rubik's cube. This means that there are far fewer combinations to consider, and it is easier to find a solution by trial and error or following a simple algorithm.

While the 2x2 Rubik's cube is easier to solve than the larger cubes, it still requires some spatial reasoning and problem-solving skills. However, there are many tutorials and resources available online to help beginners learn how to solve the 2x2 Rubik's cube.
