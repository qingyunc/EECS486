There are currently a total of 1008 different species of Pokémon in the official Pokémon franchise, spread across nine generations [1]. This count includes all species of Pokémon that have been released since the franchise's inception in 1996, including legendary and mythical Pokémon that can be obtained through special events or other means. It is worth noting that not all of these Pokémon may be catchable in any one specific game, and the number of Pokémon included in each game can vary.
