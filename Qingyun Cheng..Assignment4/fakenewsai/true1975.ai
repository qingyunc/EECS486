No, a pound of feathers is not heavier than a pound of bricks. This is because a pound is a unit of weight or mass, and both a pound of feathers and a pound of bricks weigh the same amount, which is one pound.

However, the volume or size of a pound of feathers will be much larger than the volume or size of a pound of bricks. This is because feathers are less dense than bricks, which means that a pound of feathers will take up more space or volume than a pound of bricks.
