B. Meteor impacts in the Atlantic Ocean is not a process that generates tsunamis. While meteor impacts can cause massive waves, they are not classified as tsunamis because they do not result from the displacement of water due to seismic activity. Tsunamis are most commonly generated by subduction zone earthquakes, but can also be caused by other types of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.
