A stock, also known as a share or equity, represents a unit of ownership in a publicly traded company. When a company decides to raise capital by issuing stocks, it divides its ownership into small units, called shares or stocks, and sells them to the public through a stock exchange. When an investor buys a stock, they become a shareholder and own a portion of the company. Shareholders are entitled to vote on company matters such as electing board members, and may receive dividends if the company makes a profit. The value of a stock can fluctuate based on a variety of factors, such as company performance, market trends, and global events. Investing in stocks can provide an opportunity for long-term growth and capital appreciation, but it also involves risks, including the possibility of losing money if the value of the stock decreases.
