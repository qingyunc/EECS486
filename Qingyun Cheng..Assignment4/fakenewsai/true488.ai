There is a species of jellyfish, known as the "immortal jellyfish" or Turritopsis dohrnii, that is capable of reverting back to its juvenile polyp state after reaching adulthood. When conditions are unfavorable, such as in response to injury or starvation, the jellyfish can transform its adult cells back into immature cells, essentially reversing the aging process and allowing it to start anew. This process, known as transdifferentiation, is unique among animals and allows the jellyfish to potentially live forever, barring disease, predation, or other external factors. While the jellyfish's ability to achieve true immortality is still up for debate, researchers are studying its unique life cycle in the hopes of unlocking new insights into the aging process and potential applications for regenerative medicine.
