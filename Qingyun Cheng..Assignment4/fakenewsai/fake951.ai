As far as I know, there is no officially designated city plan for the capital of Mars. There have been proposals and ideas for potential future settlements on the planet, but no specific city plan has been chosen or implemented yet. The focus of current and planned Mars missions is primarily on scientific exploration and research, with the long-term goal of potentially establishing a human presence on the planet.
