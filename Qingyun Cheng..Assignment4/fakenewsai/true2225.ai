Cats have whiskers, also known as vibrissae or tactile hairs, for several reasons. Whiskers are specialized hairs that help cats navigate their environment by providing sensory information about objects, distances and movements, even in the dark. They are also important for communication and can give hints about a cat's mood or whether they are feeling threatened. Additionally, whiskers serve as an extension of a cat's sense of touch and are highly sensitive to detect even the slightest change in air currents or temperature which can help cats hunt or avoid danger. Overall, whiskers are a vital part of a cat's anatomy and provide essential sensory information to help them move around and interact with their environment [1].
