According to the World Bank, Vietnam's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2019 was $261.9 billion USD.

Vietnam's economy has been growing rapidly over the past decade, with an average annual growth rate of around 6-7%. In 2019, Vietnam continued to experience strong economic growth, with GDP increasing by 7.0%, driven by robust domestic demand, export-oriented manufacturing, and a growing services sector.

One key factor contributing to Vietnam's economic growth is its integration into global supply chains. Vietnam has become an increasingly attractive destination for foreign investors seeking lower labor costs and a skilled workforce, particularly in the manufacturing and electronics industries. Additionally, Vietnam has made significant progress in trade liberalization, including the signing of various trade agreements, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), which are expected to boost exports and attract further foreign investment.

However, like many countries around the world, Vietnam's economy was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, with lower growth rates than in previous years. Nonetheless, Vietnam has demonstrated resilience during the pandemic, with effective containment measures and a diversified export base helping to mitigate some of the negative economic impacts.
