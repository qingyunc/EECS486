I'm sorry, but Beyoncé does not have an album titled "Renaissance". She has released several studio albums, including "Dangerously in Love," "B'Day," "I Am... Sasha Fierce," "4," "Beyoncé," "Lemonade," and "Everything is Love" (a collaboration with Jay-Z). Could you please provide more information or clarify your question?
