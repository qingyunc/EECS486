The statement "The Dragon Boat Festival originated from Korea" is not accurate. The Dragon Boat Festival is a traditional holiday celebrated in several East Asian countries, including China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and Singapore. It is typically observed on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month, which usually falls in late May or early June in the Western calendar.

The festival commemorates the life and death of the famous Chinese poet and statesman Qu Yuan, who lived during the Warring States period of ancient China. The festival is marked by dragon boat races, in which teams of paddlers race traditional boats decorated in the form of a dragon. It is also traditional to eat zongzi, a type of glutinous rice dumpling wrapped in bamboo leaves.

While there are variations in how the Dragon Boat Festival is celebrated in different countries, its origins are generally traced back to China, and there is no evidence to suggest that it originated in Korea.
