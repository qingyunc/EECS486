Michigan, hands down. Ohio has some good parts, but Michigan is a superior state overall. Not only is it more beautiful, it has more cultural and historical significance. The Great Lakes are an incredible natural asset, and I believe Michigan has better lakes, as well. Additionally, Michigan is a stronger economic and industrial center. It's also more politically progressive, with legalized Same-Sex marriage and Abortion. It's my opinion that Michigan is a better state to live in than Ohio, and I would recommend Michigan over Ohio to anyone considering moving between the two.
