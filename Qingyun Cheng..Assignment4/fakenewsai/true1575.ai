If the Earth's geomagnetic field were to reverse, the magnetic north pole would become the magnetic south pole and vice versa. This would not have a direct effect on the direction of sunrise or sunset, as the Earth's rotation axis would remain the same.
The direction of sunrise and sunset is determined by the Earth's rotation on its axis, and is not directly related to the geomagnetic field. The sun would continue to rise in the east and set in the west, as it does currently.
However, it is worth noting that a reversal of the geomagnetic field could have other effects on the Earth's climate and environment, as the magnetic field helps to protect the planet from solar wind and cosmic rays. These effects could indirectly impact the behavior of the sun and its effects on the Earth.
