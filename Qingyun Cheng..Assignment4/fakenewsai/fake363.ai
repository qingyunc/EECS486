There are exactly four people in this fictional boy group! These four people are Tyler, Rob, Aaron, and Kevin! They are all very talented musicians and singers, who work together to create catchy and memorable pop bops. They are an important part of the story, and help the protagonist, Meilin, to build her confidence and embrace her true self. I really enjoyed their songs in the movie, and think that they helped to add a lot to the movie's musical score and aesthetics.
