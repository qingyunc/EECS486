Blockchain could potentially be a good solution for sensitive information stored about each student at the University of Michigan in Wolverine Access.

One of the key features of blockchain is its ability to securely store and manage data in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. This makes it ideal for managing sensitive data that needs to be protected against unauthorized access or modification.

By using a blockchain-based system, the University of Michigan could create a tamper-proof and decentralized record of student information that would be accessible to authorized parties, while also ensuring the privacy and security of the data. Additionally, blockchain could provide a transparent and auditable system for tracking changes to student information, which would enhance the integrity and trustworthiness of the information stored in Wolverine Access.

However, the implementation of a blockchain-based system would require careful consideration and planning, as it involves significant technical, regulatory, and ethical challenges.
