While it is possible for zebras to have a genetic mutation that causes them to lack pigment and appear white, true albino zebras are extremely rare. This is because the stripes on a zebra's coat are actually formed by pigment-containing cells called melanocytes, which are responsible for the black coloration. In order for a zebra to be albino, it would need to lack both black and white pigment, resulting in a pure white coat with pink eyes. Although there have been a few reported sightings of white zebras, it is more likely that they are simply pale or partially leucistic (partially lacking pigment) rather than true albinos.
