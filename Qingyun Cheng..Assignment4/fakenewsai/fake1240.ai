Mike Ross, the main character in the TV show "Suits," decided to become a lawyer after being inspired by a law professor named Gerard, who taught a course he attended while pretending to be a Harvard Law School student. In the show's pilot episode, Mike was working as a low-level drug dealer and had dropped out of college after being expelled from a pre-med program. He stumbled into a law firm interview while fleeing from the police and impressed the firm's senior partner, Harvey Specter, with his quick wit and eidetic memory. Despite not having a law degree, Harvey hired Mike as his associate, and Mike started working at the firm while studying for the bar exam. Over time, Mike became more committed to his new profession and eventually decided to pursue a legal career full-time.
