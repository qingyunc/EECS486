Recall rate, also known as recall or sensitivity, is a statistical measure that indicates the proportion of relevant results that are correctly retrieved among the total number of relevant results available in the dataset. In other words, recall measures the completeness of a model or system by indicating how often it correctly identifies all relevant cases. It is typically expressed as a percentage or decimal between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating greater recall. For example, if a model correctly identifies 8 out of 10 relevant cases, the recall rate would be 80% (or 0.8).
