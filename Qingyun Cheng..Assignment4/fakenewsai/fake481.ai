If you're flying on an airplane and you get a window seat on the left side of the plane, you'll actually get to your destination faster than if you were sitting on the right side. This is because the earth rotates counterclockwise, and the rotation causes the air currents to move in the same direction. This means that flights traveling in a westerly direction will experience a tailwind on the left side of the plane, which helps to push the aircraft along and increase its speed.
