No, if (X, <) is isomorphic to a subset of R with the usual <, then X is not necessarily countable.
A set is countable if it is finite or can be put in one-to-one correspondence with the set of natural numbers. Being isomorphic to a subset of R with the usual < only implies that X is a totally ordered set with the same order type as a subset of R, but this does not necessarily imply that X is countable.
For example, the set of real numbers in the interval (0,1) is isomorphic to the set of all positive rational numbers, which is a countable set. However, the set of real numbers in the interval (0,1] is isomorphic to the set of positive rational numbers union {1}, which is not countable. Therefore, whether X is countable or not depends on its specific order type, and being isomorphic to a subset of R is not sufficient to determine this.
