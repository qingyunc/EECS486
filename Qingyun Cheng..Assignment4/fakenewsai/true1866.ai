The capacity of a Boeing 747 aircraft can vary depending on the specific model and configuration, but it typically ranges from around 416 to 660 passengers in a standard three-class layout. However, some airlines have configured their 747s with more seats, while others have used them for luxury VIP and charter flights with fewer seats. The cargo version of the 747, known as the 747-400ERF, can carry up to 248,600 pounds (112,760 kg) of cargo.
