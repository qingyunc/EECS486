There are several ways that it can be demonstrated that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was one of the most secure in American history:

Collaboration among federal, state, and local officials: The 2020 election saw unprecedented levels of cooperation and coordination among various governmental entities responsible for securing the election. This included the Election Infrastructure Government Coordinating Council (GCC), the Election Infrastructure Sector Coordinating Council (SCC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other agencies. These entities worked together to share information and best practices, identify potential threats, and develop strategies to mitigate risks.
Use of technology: The 2020 election made use of new and innovative technologies to secure the election. For example, many states implemented more advanced voting machines and ballot scanners, which reduced the risk of human error and made it easier to verify the accuracy of the results. Additionally, states used electronic poll books to check voter registration and avoid long lines, and some even used mobile voting apps to facilitate remote voting for military personnel and other eligible voters.
Independent audits and recounts: In the aftermath of the 2020 election, several states conducted audits and recounts of their election results to ensure the accuracy of the vote count. These audits and recounts were conducted by independent third-party organizations and overseen by bipartisan election officials to ensure transparency and impartiality.
Lack of evidence of widespread fraud: Despite claims of widespread voter fraud and irregularities, numerous courts, including the Supreme Court, rejected these claims and found no evidence of fraud or irregularities that would have changed the outcome of the election. Additionally, independent fact-checkers and news organizations scrutinized these claims and found them to be unsupported by evidence.
Taken together, these factors suggest that the 2020 U.S. presidential election was one of the most secure in American history.
