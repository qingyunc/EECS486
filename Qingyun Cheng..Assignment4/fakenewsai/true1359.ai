In Drop D tuning, the strings of a guitar are tuned to the following pitches (from the lowest-pitched string to the highest-pitched string):

D - A - D - G - B - E

This tuning is achieved by dropping the lowest-pitched string, which is normally tuned to an E, down one whole step to a D. The other strings remain in standard tuning, with the exception of the low E string, which is now tuned down to D. Drop D tuning is commonly used in rock and metal music, as it allows guitarists to play power chords more easily and creates a heavier, more aggressive sound.
