According to PETRONAS' financial statements, the company recorded a profit after tax (PAT) of RM 40.5 billion (approximately USD 9.6 billion) for the fiscal year 2019. This represents a significant increase in profitability compared to the previous fiscal year, driven by higher revenues from the company's upstream and downstream operations. However, it's important to note that these figures are in Malaysian Ringgit (MYR) and are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
