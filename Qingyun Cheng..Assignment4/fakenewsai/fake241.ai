The largest company with a horse as the logo is Ferrari, an Italian luxury sports car manufacturer. The iconic Ferrari logo features a prancing horse on a yellow background, which was originally used by Italian World War I flying ace Francesco Baracca. Enzo Ferrari, the founder of Ferrari, met Baracca's parents in the 1920s and was inspired by the horse emblem on Baracca's plane. He decided to use it as the logo for his new company, and it has since become one of the most recognizable logos in the world. Today, Ferrari is a global brand with a range of products and services, including sports cars, clothing, and accessories, and it is considered one of the world's most valuable brands.
