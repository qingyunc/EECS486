The Earth orbits around the Sun in an elliptical path, taking about 365.25 days to complete one orbit, which we call a year. This orbit is due to the gravitational force of the Sun acting upon the Earth, keeping it in its path. The Earth's distance from the Sun varies throughout the year, with the closest point being in early January and the farthest point being in early July. The orbit of the Earth also causes the seasons, as the tilt of the Earth's axis affects the angle at which sunlight hits different parts of the planet. Overall, the Earth's orbit around the Sun plays a crucial role in the planet's climate and life cycles.
