Ingress filtering for spoofed IP source addresses can be an effective measure to prevent DDoS attacks that utilize amplification to multiply the attacker's bandwidth. This technique, also known as source address validation or anti-spoofing, involves verifying that incoming packets have a legitimate source IP address, rather than one that has been forged or spoofed by the attacker.

By dropping packets with spoofed source IP addresses at the network edge, ingress filtering can prevent attackers from amplifying their DDoS attacks by sending a flood of spoofed packets to vulnerable servers or devices, which then respond with much larger packets to the victim's IP address. This type of attack, known as an amplification attack, can multiply the attacker's bandwidth by a factor of up to several hundred times, making it very difficult to defend against.
