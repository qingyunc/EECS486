A chair is a piece of furniture designed for one person to sit on, typically having a back, four legs, and sometimes armrests. It is often used for seating at a table or desk, or for relaxation or conversation in a living room or other communal space.

The word "chair" can also be used in a broader sense to refer to the person who presides over a meeting or event, or to a position of authority in an organization or institution, such as the chair of a committee or board.
