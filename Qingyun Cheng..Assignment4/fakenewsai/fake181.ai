1kg of feathers and 2kg of rocks both weigh the same, which is 1 kilogram (or 1000 grams). The confusion in this common riddle lies in the fact that feathers are much lighter in weight than rocks, but in order to have the same total weight as the 2kg of rocks, you need to have 2 times the amount of feathers, which in this case would be 2kg of feathers. So, while 1kg of feathers is much bulkier and takes up more space than 2kg of rocks, they weigh the same amount.
