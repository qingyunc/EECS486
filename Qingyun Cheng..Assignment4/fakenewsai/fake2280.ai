Natural peanut butter, made with just peanuts and salt, can be a healthy food as it contains beneficial nutrients. Peanuts are a good source of protein, fiber, and healthy fats, as well as vitamins and minerals such as vitamin E, magnesium, and potassium.
Studies have shown that consuming nuts and nut butters, including peanut butter, can have a number of health benefits. For example, a 2015 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that consuming nuts or peanut butter was associated with a reduced risk of heart disease and overall mortality.
