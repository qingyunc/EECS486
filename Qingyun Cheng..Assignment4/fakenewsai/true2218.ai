The famous advertising slogan for Tootsie Pop posed this question: "How many licks does it take to get to the Tootsie Roll center of a Tootsie Pop?" While the answer may vary depending on factors such as the size and shape of the person's tongue and how much saliva they produce, a group of engineering students from Purdue University conducted a study in 2015 and found that it takes an average of 364 licks to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop.
