The last state to be added to the United States was Hawaii, which became the 50th state on August 21, 1959. At that time, Hawaii was a territory of the United States, and its admission as a state followed a long period of debate and controversy over issues such as its status as a territory, its cultural identity, and its political and economic relationship with the United States. Today, Hawaii is a popular tourist destination known for its beautiful beaches, lush landscapes, and rich cultural heritage.
