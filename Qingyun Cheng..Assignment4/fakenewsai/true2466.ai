Yes, it is true that if P = NP, then NP = coNP. This is because P is closed under complement, meaning that for any problem in P, its complement is also in P. Therefore, if P = NP, then for any problem in NP, its complement is also in P (and vice versa). But the complement of a problem in NP is exactly a problem in coNP. So if P = NP, then NP and coNP are equal. Are you familiar with the definitions of these classes?
