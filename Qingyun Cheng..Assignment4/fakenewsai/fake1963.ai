As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there are 12 NFL teams that have never won a Super Bowl, and therefore have never played in a Super Bowl game. These teams are:
1. Arizona Cardinals
2. Atlanta Falcons
3. Buffalo Bills
4. Carolina Panthers
5. Cincinnati Bengals
6. Cleveland Browns
7. Detroit Lions
8. Houston Texans
9. Los Angeles Chargers (formerly the San Diego Chargers)
10. Minnesota Vikings
11. Tennessee Titans (formerly the Houston Oilers)
12. Jacksonville Jaguars
It's worth noting that some of these teams have come close to making it to the Super Bowl in the past, with several of them reaching their respective conference championship games. However, they have yet to win their conference and advance to the Super Bowl.
