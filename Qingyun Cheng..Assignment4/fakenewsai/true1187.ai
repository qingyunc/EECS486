Ramadan is a lunar month in the Islamic calendar, which means it moves back by about 11 days every year compared to the Gregorian calendar, which is the commonly used calendar in Western countries. This means that Ramadan can occur in any season depending on the year.

While it is more common for Ramadan to occur during the summer months due to the lunar calendar, it is possible for it to occur in the winter. In fact, it is expected that over the next few decades, Ramadan will gradually shift from occurring in the summer to occurring in the winter due to the way the lunar calendar aligns with the solar calendar over long periods of time.

However, it's important to note that the exact timing of Ramadan can vary from year to year and is determined by the sighting of the crescent moon, so it's not possible to predict exactly when Ramadan will occur in a specific season.
