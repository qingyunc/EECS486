While cats are known for drinking milk, it is not recommended to give them cow's milk as many cats are lactose intolerant and can have digestive issues. Kittens typically drink their mother's milk until they are weaned, and after that, they usually don't need milk as part of their diet. If you want to give your cat a special treat, you can try giving them a small amount of lactose-free milk or a specially formulated cat milk available at pet stores. However, it's important to remember that water is the most important liquid for cats to consume.
