If your Nissan Skyline R34 GTR was manufactured in 1993, it will become legal to import to the United States in 2024, assuming it meets all of the other US Customs and Border Protection requirements for importing a vehicle.

Under the US federal regulation known as the "25-year rule," any vehicle that is at least 25 years old and meets certain safety and emissions standards can be imported into the United States without having to comply with the US Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations.

The R34 GTR was never sold in the United States, so it is considered a "gray market" vehicle, and it will need to be modified to comply with the FMVSS and EPA regulations to be legally registered and operated on US roads. Additionally, you will need to ensure that the vehicle has all of the required documentation, such as a foreign title and bill of sale, to complete the importation process.
