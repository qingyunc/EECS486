No, multiplication on ordinals does not necessarily preserve commutativity.
While the multiplication of two natural numbers is commutative (i.e., ab = ba), this is not the case for ordinal multiplication in general.
For example, consider the ordinal multiplication of ω and 2. We can define ω as the order type of the natural numbers, and 2 as the order type of the set {0, 1}. The ordinal product ω*2 can be thought of as taking two copies of the natural numbers and placing them end to end, with the first copy followed by the second copy.
On the other hand, the ordinal product 2*ω can be thought of as taking two copies of the set {0, 1} and placing them end to end, with the first copy followed by the second copy.
These two products have different order types and are therefore not equal, so multiplication on ordinals is not commutative in general. Specifically, we have:
ω2 ≠ 2ω
Therefore, the commutativity of ordinal multiplication depends on the specific ordinals being multiplied.
