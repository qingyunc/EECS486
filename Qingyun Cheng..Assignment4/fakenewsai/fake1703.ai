President Biden's administration has approved a new oil drilling project in Alaska that could boost US energy independence and create thousands of new jobs.
The White House announced on Wednesday that it had approved a $20 billion lease proposal for the Willow project in the Cook Inlet. The project would be the first oil and gas project in the US Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and it would be the first offshore lease sale in the Cook Inlet region in more than 30 years.
The approval could represent a major reversal of Obama-era policies aimed at slowing greenhouse gas emissions. But it's a win for energy producers.
