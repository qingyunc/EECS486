Alaska has the longest coastline of any state in the United States. The state's coastline stretches for approximately 6,640 miles (10,686 kilometers), including islands. Alaska's coastline is more than double the length of the coastline of the state with the second-longest coastline, Florida, which has a coastline of approximately 1,350 miles (2,170 kilometers). The length of a state's coastline can vary depending on how it is measured, as coastlines can be measured along every inlet and bay or only along major features, such as headlands and bays.
