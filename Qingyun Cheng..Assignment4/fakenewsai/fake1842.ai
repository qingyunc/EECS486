If you want to change the physics settings for only one specific scene, you can create a new physics layer and assign the layer to the objects in the scene. Here are the steps to do that:

Open the Main scene in Unity.

Click on the "Edit" menu at the top of the screen and select "Project Settings."

In the "Project Settings" window, select "Tags and Layers" from the left-hand menu.

In the "Tags and Layers" settings, scroll down to the "User Layer" section and click on the "+" button to add a new layer. Name the new layer something like "MainPhysics" and set the layer value to a number that's not used by any other layers.

Close the "Tags and Layers" settings window and select the objects in the Main scene that you want to apply the physics settings to.

In the Inspector panel, click on the "Add Component" button and select "Physics" -> "Physics Layer" from the menu.

In the "Physics Layer" component, set the layer to "MainPhysics".

Now, any physics settings you apply to the "MainPhysics" layer in the "Project Settings" window will only affect the objects in the Main scene that are assigned to that layer.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
