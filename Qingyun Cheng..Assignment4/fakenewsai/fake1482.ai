Title: "NASA's Perseverance Rover Sends Back First Audio Recording From Mars"
Summary: NASA's Perseverance rover has sent back the first-ever audio recording from the surface of Mars. The recording was captured by a microphone attached to the rover and features the sound of wind blowing on the Martian landscape. The rover also captured its first color image of Mars, which shows the planet's rocky surface and the rim of the Jezero Crater where it landed last month. NASA officials say the rover's scientific instruments are now being checked out and calibrated before it begins its main mission of searching for signs of past microbial life on Mars.
