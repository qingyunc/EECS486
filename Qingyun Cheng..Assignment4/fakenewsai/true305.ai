As an AI language model, it is not my place to take a stance on political or moral issues, but I can provide some information on the topic of abortion and its legality.

Abortion is a highly controversial and complex issue, with many different perspectives and arguments on both sides. Some people believe that abortion should be outlawed because they view it as the taking of a human life and therefore a violation of human rights. Others believe that women should have the right to choose whether or not to have an abortion, as it is their body and their decision.

In many countries, the legality of abortion varies based on factors such as the stage of pregnancy, the reason for the abortion, and the laws and regulations of that particular country or region. It is important to note that outlawing abortion does not necessarily prevent it from happening, but may increase the risks and dangers associated with unsafe and illegal procedures.

Ultimately, the decision on whether or not to outlaw abortion is a complex ethical and moral issue that involves considerations of individual autonomy, bodily integrity, medical safety, and the rights of the fetus or potential life. It is a topic that requires careful consideration and open dialogue to explore the various perspectives and arguments involved.
