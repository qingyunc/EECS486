There are 52 weeks in a year. However, there are occasional leap years, where an extra day is added to the calendar in order to synchronize it with the solar year. In leap years, there are 52 weeks and 2 extra days, or a total of 366 days in a year.

Yes, I'm sure. There are 52 weeks in a regular year. Each week consists of 7 days, so the total number of days in a year is 52 weeks x 7 days per week = 364 days. However, as I mentioned earlier, in leap years an extra day is added to the calendar, so there are 52 weeks and 2 extra days (or 1 extra day in case of a leap year that is divisible by 100 but not by 400) in a leap year, making the total number of days 365 or 366.
