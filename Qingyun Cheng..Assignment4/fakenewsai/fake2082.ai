If 100 men can complete 100 tasks in 100 minutes, then the total amount of work done is 100 men x 100 tasks = 10,000 task-minutes.

To find out how long 10 men would take to complete 10 tasks, we can use the formula:

(number of men 1 x time 1 x tasks 1) = (number of men 2 x time 2 x tasks 2)

Plugging in the values we have:

(100 men x 100 minutes x 100 tasks) = (10 men x t minutes x 10 tasks)

Solving for t, we get:

t = (100 men x 100 minutes x 100 tasks) / (10 men x 10 tasks) = 1000 minutes

Therefore, it would take 10 men 1000 minutes (or approximately 16.7 hours) to complete 10 tasks, assuming the tasks are of equal difficulty and that the rate of work is constant.
