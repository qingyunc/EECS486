Here's an example Python class that describes a car:

class Car:
    def __init__(self, doors, seats, gas):
        self.doors = doors
        self.seats = seats
        self.gas = gas
    
    def drive(self):
        if self.gas > 0:
            print("Driving...")
            self.gas -= 1
        else:
            print("Out of gas.")
In this class, we define a __init__ method that sets the initial values for the car's attributes of doors, seats, and gas. We also define a drive method that checks if the car has any gas left and prints a message indicating whether the car can drive or not. The drive method also subtracts 1 from the gas attribute each time it is called, simulating the car using up fuel while driving.
