No, A is not always polynomial-time reducible to B if A is Turing reducible to B. Turing reduction is a more general concept than polynomial-time reduction, which imposes an additional constraint on the running time of the reduction algorithm. Polynomial-time reduction is a stronger notion of reducibility than Turing reduction, meaning that if A is polynomial-time reducible to B, then A is also Turing reducible to B, but not necessarily the other way around. Do you want an example of two problems that are Turing reducible but not polynomial-time reducible to each other?
