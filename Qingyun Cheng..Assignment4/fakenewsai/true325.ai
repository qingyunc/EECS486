No, Donald Trump did not win the 2020 presidential election. Joe Biden won the election with 306 electoral votes to Trump's 232, and he was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States on January 20, 2021. There is no evidence to support claims of widespread voter fraud, and multiple courts, including the Supreme Court, rejected legal challenges to the election results.
