The dodo is an extinct species of bird that once inhabited the island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. The dodo is known primarily from its appearance, which is described as having a large, bulky body with a small head and short neck, along with a large, beaklike mouth full of sharp teeth. This unique look has made the dodo an animal of great interest to scientists and philosophers, and it has become a symbol of extinction and the fragility of life on Earth. While the dodo is no longer living today, its legacy continues to live on in the imagination of science, philosophy, and art.
