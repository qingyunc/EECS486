"The Michigan" is a hockey term that refers to a specific type of lacrosse-style goal where a player picks up the puck on the blade of their stick behind the net, lifts the puck up and over the net, and then tucks it into the goal on the opposite side. 

The move is named after Mike Legg, a former University of Michigan hockey player who popularized it in a game against the University of Minnesota in 1996. Legg scored a goal using this move, which was then dubbed "The Michigan" and has since become a memorable moment in hockey history. 

The move is a difficult one to execute, and not many players have been able to replicate it successfully in games. However, it is still sometimes attempted by skilled players looking to add some flair to their game.
