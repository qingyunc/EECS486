Yes, the CRISPR gene editing technology has been tested on humans in several clinical trials. The first clinical trial using CRISPR to treat a human genetic disease was initiated in 2016. Since then, several other clinical trials using CRISPR have been conducted or are ongoing, primarily for the treatment of genetic diseases and cancer.

One of the most notable trials involved the use of CRISPR to treat sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, two genetic blood disorders. In 2019, a group of researchers in the United States published results from a clinical trial in which they used CRISPR to edit the genes of patients with these disorders. The trial was small and only included a few patients, but the results were encouraging, with some patients showing significant improvements in their condition.

It is important to note that gene editing technologies like CRISPR are still relatively new, and there are concerns about the safety and ethical implications of their use. Clinical trials using these technologies are closely monitored by regulatory bodies to ensure that they are conducted in a responsible and ethical manner, and that the risks and benefits are carefully evaluated.
