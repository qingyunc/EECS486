According to the principle of equivalence in general relativity, the gravitational force is locally equivalent to an accelerating force, which means that the effects of gravity can be indistinguishable from the effects of acceleration. This principle implies that the gravitational force is a reversible force, which means that the direction of the force can be reversed.

One example of a study that provides evidence for the reversible nature of gravity is the experiment conducted by Robert Dicke and his colleagues in 1964, known as the Eötvös-Dicke-Pritchard experiment. The experiment was designed to test the equivalence principle by measuring the difference in the acceleration of two different materials (aluminum and platinum) in response to the Earth's gravitational field.

The results of the experiment showed that the two materials fell with the same acceleration to within a precision of one part in 10^11, which is consistent with the principle of equivalence and the idea that gravity is a reversible force.
