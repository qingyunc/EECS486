If 4 cars can travel from Detroit to Chicago in 5 hours, then we can say that the rate of each car is:

Rate = Distance / Time

We don't know the distance between Detroit and Chicago, but we can still use this formula to calculate the rate of each car. Let's assume that the distance is d miles, then the rate of each car is:

Rate of each car = d / 5

Now, if 8 cars are traveling the same distance, we can use the same formula to calculate the time it would take for all 8 cars to arrive in Chicago:

Time = Distance / Rate

Time = d / (8 * (d / 5))

Simplifying the equation:

Time = (5 * d) / (8 * d)

Time = 0.625 hours or 37.5 minutes

Therefore, it would take 8 cars approximately 37.5 minutes to reach Chicago from Detroit, assuming the same distance and travel conditions as the 4 cars that took 5 hours.
