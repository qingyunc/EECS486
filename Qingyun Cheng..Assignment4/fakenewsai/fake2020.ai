As of my knowledge cutoff date of September 2021, the player with the most Global StarCraft II League (GSL) championships is Lim "Neeb" Dohyeon from the United States, who won three GSL tournaments. He won GSL Season 1 in 2017, GSL vs. the World in 2017, and GSL Season 3 in 2018. Neeb is a Protoss player who has been one of the top foreign players in StarCraft II, and his GSL wins are some of the biggest accomplishments in his career. Other players who have won multiple GSL championships include Lee "INnoVation" Shin Hyung, Lee "Maru" Damwon, and Park "Dark" Ryung Woo, all of whom have won two GSL tournaments each.
