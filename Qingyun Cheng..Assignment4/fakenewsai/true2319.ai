Microwaves are generally safe to use, and there is no evidence to suggest that they cause cancer.

Microwaves work by using electromagnetic waves to heat up food, which causes the water molecules in the food to vibrate, generating heat. While there have been concerns in the past about the safety of microwaves, extensive research has shown that the electromagnetic radiation produced by microwaves is not harmful to human health.

The World Health Organization states that there is no established evidence that exposure to low-level electromagnetic fields, such as those produced by microwaves, has any adverse health effects. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates microwave ovens to ensure that they meet safety standards, and most manufacturers provide instructions for safe use.

In summary, microwaves are generally safe to use, and there is no evidence to suggest that they cause cancer or any other adverse health effects.
