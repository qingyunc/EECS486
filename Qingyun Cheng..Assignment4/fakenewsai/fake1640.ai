The Great Dying, which occurred at the end of the Permian period approximately 252 million years ago, was the most severe extinction event in Earth's history, with an estimated 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species becoming extinct. The event was associated with a massive release of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, leading to global warming, ocean acidification, and other environmental changes that had severe impacts on life on Earth.

The amount of CO2 released during the Great Dying is estimated to have been much greater than the amount of CO2 being released today. The most recent estimates suggest that volcanic activity in the Siberian Traps region released between 10,000 and 30,000 gigatons of carbon into the atmosphere over a period of several thousand years, which is several orders of magnitude greater than the current annual emissions from human activities, which are estimated to be around 40 gigatons per year.
