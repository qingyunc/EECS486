No, pi (Ï€) is not a rational number. A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, i.e., in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q is not equal to zero.
However, pi is an irrational number, which means it cannot be expressed as a finite or repeating decimal, and its decimal expansion goes on infinitely without repeating. The decimal expansion of pi starts as 3.14159265358979323846..., and there is no pattern or repetition in the digits.
The irrationality of pi was first proved by the ancient Greek mathematician, Hippasus, and its proof was refined by many mathematicians over the centuries.
