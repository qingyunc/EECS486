Certainly! Here are the steps to evaluate -1 * -1 * -1:

Step 1: Multiply -1 and -1 together, which gives you 1, since two negative numbers multiplied together result in a positive number.
-1 * -1 = 1

Step 2: Multiply the result from step 1 (which is 1) by -1.
1 * -1 = -1

Step 3: Multiply the result from step 2 (which is -1) by -1 again.
-1 * -1 = 1

Therefore, the product of -1 * -1 * -1 is equal to 1.
