I think the best supporting actor this year is Brendan Fraser in The Whale. His performance is haunting and emotionally charged, and he truly embodies the character of Charlie in a way that only he could. It's a very vulnerable and genuine performance, and he really makes you feel the pain and loneliness that Charlie is experiencing in his life. He brings the character to life in such a way that makes him feel very real and human, and his performance is one of the best of the year without a doubt.
