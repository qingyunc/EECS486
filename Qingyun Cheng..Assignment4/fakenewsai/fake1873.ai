Dance Mix is an annual dance showcase organized by the student-run dance organization, Dance Mix Collective, at the University of Michigan. The showcase typically features a variety of dance styles, including contemporary, hip-hop, jazz, tap, and more, and highlights the talents of student choreographers and performers.

Dance Mix typically takes place in the fall semester, usually in November or December, and is open to the public. However, the format and scheduling of Dance Mix may be subject to change or restrictions due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
