No, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not own Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). SVB is a publicly traded company that is owned by its shareholders.

The FDIC is a U.S. government agency that provides insurance for deposits in banks and savings institutions. If a bank or savings institution fails, the FDIC may step in to protect depositors by paying out insured deposits, taking over the institution's assets, or arranging for the institution to be acquired by another bank or savings institution. However, SVB is a healthy and profitable bank, and there is no indication that it is at risk of failing or that the FDIC would need to take any action related to it.
