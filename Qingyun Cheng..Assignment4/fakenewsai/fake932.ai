It is not recommended to keep a blowfish as a pet. Blowfish are highly toxic and contain a deadly poison called tetrodotoxin that can cause paralysis, respiratory failure, and death in humans and other animals. Even a small amount of this toxin can be fatal.

Additionally, blowfish are not well-suited to life in captivity and require a specific environment to thrive, including a large aquarium with plenty of hiding places, high-quality water filtration and maintenance, and a specialized diet.

In many countries, including the United States, it is also illegal to keep a blowfish as a pet without a special permit. Therefore, it is generally not recommended or advisable to keep a blowfish as a pet due to the significant risks and difficulties involved.
