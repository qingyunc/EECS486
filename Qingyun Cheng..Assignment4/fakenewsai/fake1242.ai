Harvey Specter's relationship with Katrina Bennett in the TV show "Suits" was complicated, and at times, contentious. There were a few reasons why Harvey did not like Katrina initially:

Firstly, Katrina was hired by Louis Litt as a junior associate, and she was eager to impress Harvey and prove herself to him. However, Harvey saw her as a threat and felt that she was trying too hard to climb the ranks at the firm.

Secondly, Katrina had a reputation for being ambitious and ruthless. She was willing to do whatever it takes to get ahead, even if it meant stepping on others to achieve her goals. This rubbed Harvey the wrong way, and he saw her as a potential liability to the firm.

Thirdly, Harvey and Katrina had different working styles and clashed over their approaches to cases. Harvey was known for his unorthodox methods and willingness to bend the rules, while Katrina was more by-the-book and traditional. This led to disagreements and tension between the two characters.

Despite their rocky start, Harvey and Katrina eventually developed a mutual respect for each other and even worked together on several cases. In later seasons of the show, Katrina became a more prominent character and played an integral role in the firm's success.
