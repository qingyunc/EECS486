Japanese language classes at the University of Michigan are offered through the Department of Asian Languages and Cultures. The course numbers for Japanese language classes at U-M are as follows:

    101 - Elementary Japanese I
    102 - Elementary Japanese II
    231 - Second-Year Japanese I
    232 - Second-Year Japanese II

    These course numbers are accurate as of my knowledge cutoff of September 2021, but it's possible that they may have changed since then.
