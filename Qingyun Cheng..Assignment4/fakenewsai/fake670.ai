No, a Pokémon with only Ice and Electric type moves cannot hit every single type of Pokémon for at least neutral damage. While the combination of Ice and Electric type moves provides coverage against a wide range of Pokémon, there are still a few types that resist both Ice and Electric moves, and therefore would take reduced damage:

- Ground type Pokémon are immune to Electric moves, and most also resist Ice moves, taking only 1/2 damage.

- Dragon type Pokémon resist both Ice and Electric moves, taking only 1/2 damage.

- Grass type Pokémon resist Electric moves and some also resist Ice moves, taking only 1/2 damage.

- Electric type Pokémon themselves resist Electric moves and are immune to paralysis caused by them.

Finally, there are a few dual type Pokémon that have both types that resist both Ice and Electric moves, such as Shedinja, which has Ghost and Bug types.

Therefore, while a Pokémon with Ice and Electric type moves can hit many types of Pokémon effectively, it is not able to hit every single type of Pokémon for at least neutral damage.
