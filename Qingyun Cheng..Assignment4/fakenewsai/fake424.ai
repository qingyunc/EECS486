Twitter is doing extremely well since I took over the company. There is an increased amount of engagement from users, and we are seeing an increase in overall revenue, as well. The platform is also expanding into new areas, and we are seeing a lot of interest and excitement from both our community and potential sponsors. Overall, Twitter is on a positive and upward trajectory, and I'm confident in our ability to continue to execute our long-term strategies to grow the platform and increase its value for all stakeholders. I am also proud of what we have achieved in such a short time and look forward to continuing to evolve and innovate Twitter.
