Barack Obama was inaugurated as the 44th President of the United States on January 20, 2009.

During the Democratic Party primaries for the 2008 presidential election, Barack Obama won the nomination after a long and closely contested race against Hillary Clinton, who was then a U.S. Senator from New York. Obama went on to beat the Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, in the general election.
