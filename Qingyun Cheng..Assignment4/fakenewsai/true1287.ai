The largest cell in the world is the ostrich egg cell. It is about 170 millimeters long and 130 millimeters wide, which is roughly equivalent to the size of a grapefruit. While an ostrich egg is a single cell, it is important to note that it is an unusual and unique type of cell. In general, most cells in living organisms are much smaller than an ostrich egg cell.
